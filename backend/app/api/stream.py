SSE Streaming Endpoint

Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for real-time event streaming to frontend.

Key features:
- Streams events from Redis as they're emitted
- Supports replay (reconnection with last sequence)
- Keepalive heartbeat every 15 seconds
- Auto-terminates on completion (message_final event)

Usage:
    # Frontend JavaScript - use the same conversation_id from your chat request
    const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/chat/conv_test_123/stream?after_sequence=0');
    eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        console.log(data.event_type, data);
    };

    Stream real-time events for a chat conversation using SSE.
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Use the same `conversation_id` from your POST /api/chat request.
    Events are stored by conversation_id, so you must use the same value here.
    
    **SSE Protocol:**
    - Opens long-lived HTTP connection
    - Streams events as they occur
    - Client automatically reconnects on disconnect
    
    **Reconnection Support:**
    - Client tracks last sequence number received
    - On reconnect, pass `after_sequence` to resume from that point
    - No events are lost
    
    **Event Format:**
    ```
    data: {"event_type": "thinking_start", "sequence": 1, ...}
    
    data: {"event_type": "tool_start", "sequence": 2, "tool_name": "validate_process_inputs"}
    
    data: {"event_type": "run_progress", "sequence": 5, "percentage": 33}
    
    data: {"event_type": "message_final", "sequence": 12, "content": "Calculation complete!"}
    ```
    
    **Stream Termination:**
    - Stream ends when `message_final` event is sent
    - Client receives last event and connection closes gracefully
    
    Args:
        conversation_id: The conversation identifier (same as used in POST /api/chat)
        after_sequence: Resume from this sequence number (default: 0 = all events)
