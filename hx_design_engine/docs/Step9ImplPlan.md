## 1. What Step 9 Does

Step 9 is the **aggregation step**. It takes the individual thermal resistances computed in Steps 4–8 and assembles them into the overall heat transfer coefficient (U). It answers three questions:

1. **What's the calculated U?** — Compare against the Step 6 initial estimate
2. **What's controlling the design?** — Which resistance is the bottleneck?
3. **Is U reasonable?** — Cross-check against Kern method and typical ranges

This is the "moment of truth" where all previous steps' outputs combine into a single design-critical number. If U_calculated differs significantly from U_estimated (Step 6), the geometry is wrong and Step 12 convergence will need to iterate.

## 2. Formula & Engineering Background

### 2.1 Overall U (referenced to outside tube surface)

$$\frac{1}{U_o} = \frac{1}{h_o} + R_{f,o} + \frac{d_o \ln(d_o / d_i)}{2 k_w} + R_{f,i} \cdot \frac{d_o}{d_i} + \frac{1}{h_i} \cdot \frac{d_o}{d_i}$$

Where:

- $h_o$ = shell-side film coefficient (Step 8, Bell-Delaware) [W/m²·K]
- $h_i$ = tube-side film coefficient (Step 7, Gnielinski/Hausen) [W/m²·K]
- $R_{f,o}$ = shell-side (outer) fouling resistance [m²·K/W]
- $R_{f,i}$ = tube-side (inner) fouling resistance [m²·K/W]
- $d_o$ = tube outer diameter [m]
- $d_i$ = tube inner diameter [m]
- $k_w$ = tube wall thermal conductivity [W/m·K]

### 2.2 Why the d_o/d_i Ratio?

For cylindrical geometry, inner resistances must be converted to the outer reference area. The ratio $d_o / d_i$ accounts for the area difference between inner and outer tube surfaces. This is standard per Serth Chapter 3 and Kern Chapter 11.

### 2.3 Clean vs Dirty U

- **U_clean:** Computed WITHOUT fouling terms ($R_{f,o} = R_{f,i} = 0$)
- **U_dirty:** Computed WITH fouling terms (this is the design U — `U_calculated`)
- **Cleanliness Factor:** $CF = U_{dirty} / U_{clean}$ — typical range 0.75–0.95

The cleanliness factor tells how much of U is "lost" to fouling. If CF < 0.60, fouling dominates — the exchanger is designed more for dirt than for heat transfer.

### 2.4 Wall Resistance Term

Using the `ht` library's `R_cylinder()` function:

$$R_{wall} = R\_{cylinder}(d_i, d_o, k_w, L=1)$$

This computes $\frac{\ln(d_o / d_i)}{2 \pi k_w}$ for unit length. We then convert to area-based resistance: $R_{wall, area} = R_{wall} \cdot \pi \cdot d_o$ to get the per-unit-area resistance referenced to the outer surface.

Alternatively, the direct formula $\frac{d_o \ln(d_o / d_i)}{2 k_w}$ is used. Both are equivalent — `R_cylinder` provides the validated math.

### 2.5 Resistance Breakdown

Each term in the 1/U equation is a resistance. Express each as a percentage of total 1/U:

| Resistance         | Symbol                      | Typical Range |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Shell-side film    | $1/h_o$                     | 15–40%        |
| Tube-side film     | $(d_o/d_i)/h_i$             | 15–40%        |
| Shell-side fouling | $R_{f,o}$                   | 5–25%         |
| Tube-side fouling  | $R_{f,i} \cdot d_o/d_i$     | 5–25%         |
| Wall conduction    | $d_o \ln(d_o/d_i) / (2k_w)$ | 1–15%         |

**Engineering insight:** The controlling resistance depends on the fluid pair:

- **Oil/water:** Shell-side film + fouling dominate (oil is viscous)
- **Gas/liquid:** Gas-side film dominates (gases have low h)
- **Water/water:** Fouling often dominates (both films are high)
- **Exotic alloy tubes:** Wall resistance becomes significant (k=15 for Inconel)

## 3. Inputs (from DesignState)

All inputs are already on DesignState from previous steps. Step 9 reads — does not call external services in Layer 1.

| Tube-side h            | `h_tube_W_m2K`                | Step 7                    | Yes                       |
| Shell-side fouling R_f | depends on `shell_side_fluid` | Step 4                    | Yes                       |
| Tube-side fouling R_f  | depends on `shell_side_fluid` | Step 4                    | Yes                       |
| Tube OD                | `geometry.tube_od_m`          | Step 4/6                  | Yes                       |
| Tube ID                | `geometry.tube_id_m`          | Step 4/6                  | Yes                       |
| Shell-side fluid       | `shell_side_fluid`            | Step 4                    | Yes                       |
| R_f hot                | `R_f_hot_m2KW`                | Step 4                    | Yes                       |
| R_f cold               | `R_f_cold_m2KW`               | Step 4                    | Yes                       |
| Kern shell-side h      | `h_shell_kern_W_m2K`          | Step 8                    | Optional                  |

### 3.1 Fouling Mapping: Hot/Cold → Inner/Outer

This is critical. The formula uses $R_{f,o}$ (outer = shell-side) and $R_{f,i}$ (inner = tube-side). DesignState stores `R_f_hot_m2KW` and `R_f_cold_m2KW`. The mapping depends on fluid allocation:

```python
if state.shell_side_fluid == "hot":
    R_f_outer = state.R_f_hot_m2KW    # shell = hot fluid
    R_f_inner = state.R_f_cold_m2KW   # tube = cold fluid
else:  # shell_side_fluid == "cold"
    R_f_outer = state.R_f_cold_m2KW   # shell = cold fluid
    R_f_inner = state.R_f_hot_m2KW    # tube = hot fluid
```

## 5. Layer 1: Execute — Calculation Logic

### 5.1 Class Definition

```python
class Step09OverallU(BaseStep):
    step_id: int = 9
    step_name: str = "Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient"
    ai_mode: AIModeEnum = AIModeEnum.FULL

    @staticmethod
    def _check_preconditions(state: "DesignState") -> list[str]:
        """Check upstream outputs exist."""

    def _conditional_ai_trigger(self, state: "DesignState") -> bool:
        """
        Returns False when in_convergence_loop=True.
        This skips AI during Step 12 iterations while keeping ai_mode=FULL.
        Outside convergence, AI is always called.
        """
        return not state.in_convergence_loop

    async def execute(self, state: "DesignState") -> StepResult:
        """Layer 1: Pure calculation of overall U and resistance breakdown."""
```

### 5.2 Execute Flow (Pseudocode)

```
1. Precondition check
   - Require: h_shell_W_m2K, h_tube_W_m2K, geometry (tube_od, tube_id),
     R_f_hot_m2KW, R_f_cold_m2KW, shell_side_fluid
   - Fail with CalculationError if any missing

2. Resolve tube material and k_wall
   a. If state.k_wall_W_mK already set → use it (from prior step or convergence iteration)
   b. Else → use MaterialPropertyAdapter.get_k_wall()
      - Determines material from resolve_material_from_fluid()
      - Queries material stub (ASME table lookup)
   c. Store material props on state

3. Map fouling resistances to inner/outer
   - Based on state.shell_side_fluid ("hot" or "cold")

4. Compute individual resistances (all in m²·K/W, outer reference)
   R_shell_film = 1 / h_shell
   R_tube_film  = (d_o / d_i) / h_tube
   R_shell_foul = R_f_outer
   R_tube_foul  = R_f_inner * (d_o / d_i)
   R_wall       = d_o * ln(d_o / d_i) / (2 * k_w)

5. Compute 1/U and U
   total_dirty = sum of all 5 resistances
   total_clean = total_dirty - R_shell_foul - R_tube_foul
   U_dirty = 1 / total_dirty
   U_clean = 1 / total_clean

6. Compute cleanliness factor
   CF = U_dirty / U_clean

7. Compute resistance breakdown (each as % of total)

8. Identify controlling resistance (largest %)

9. Compute Kern cross-check U (if h_shell_kern available)
   Same formula, replacing h_shell with h_shell_kern
   deviation_pct = abs(U_dirty - U_kern) / U_dirty * 100

10. Compute deviation from Step 6 estimate
    deviation_from_est = (U_dirty - U_estimated) / U_estimated * 100

11. Write k_wall results to state:
    state.tube_material = material_name
    state.k_wall_W_mK = k_w
    state.k_wall_source = source
    state.k_wall_confidence = confidence

12. Build outputs dict + warnings list
    Return StepResult
```

### 5.3 Warnings Generation

```python
warnings = []

if CF < 0.65:
    warnings.append(f"Cleanliness factor {CF:.2f} is low — fouling dominates design")

if k_wall_source == "stub_default":
    warnings.append(f"Tube wall conductivity from stub default ({k_w} W/mK) — "
                     "ASME data unavailable, verify material")

if U_kern_deviation_pct and U_kern_deviation_pct > 15:
    warnings.append(f"Bell-Delaware/Kern U deviation: {U_kern_deviation_pct:.1f}% — "
                     "check geometry assumptions")

if abs(U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct) > 30:
    warnings.append(f"Calculated U deviates {U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct:.1f}% from "
                     f"Step 6 estimate — geometry iteration likely needed")

if wall_pct > 10:
    warnings.append(f"Wall resistance is {wall_pct:.1f}% of total — "
                     "verify tube material selection")
```

### 5.4 Escalation Hints

```python
escalation_hints = []

if U_dirty < 50:
    escalation_hints.append("U < 50 W/m²K — extremely low, check for gas-side controlling")

if U_kern_deviation_pct and U_kern_deviation_pct > 25:
    escalation_hints.append(f"BD/Kern U deviation {U_kern_deviation_pct:.1f}% > 25% — "
                             "geometry may have issues")

if CF < 0.50:
    escalation_hints.append(f"CF = {CF:.2f} — fouling resistance exceeds all other "
                             "resistances combined, review fouling assumptions")
```

## 7. Layer 3: AI Review

### 7.1 AI Mode Behavior

```python
ai_mode = AIModeEnum.FULL

def _conditional_ai_trigger(self, state: "DesignState") -> bool:
    """
    FULL mode means AI is always called — _conditional_ai_trigger is the
    only override that can skip it. We skip during convergence iterations
    since intermediate U values are meaningless. The final converged U
    gets the full AI review after Step 12 exits.
    """
    return not state.in_convergence_loop
```

**How this works with BaseStep.\_should_call_ai():**

Looking at `base.py`:

- `ai_mode=FULL` → `_should_call_ai()` returns True always
- BUT `_conditional_ai_trigger()` is only checked for `CONDITIONAL` mode

**Important:** We need to verify the BaseStep flow. If FULL mode bypasses
`_conditional_ai_trigger()`, we have two options:

**Option A:** Override `_should_call_ai()` directly in Step09:

```python
def _should_call_ai(self, state: "DesignState") -> bool:
    if state.in_convergence_loop:
        return False
    return True  # FULL mode — always call outside convergence
```

**Option B:** Change ai_mode to CONDITIONAL and always return True from trigger except in convergence:

```python
ai_mode = AIModeEnum.CONDITIONAL

def _conditional_ai_trigger(self, state: "DesignState") -> bool:
    return not state.in_convergence_loop
```

**Decision required at implementation time:** Check BaseStep.\_should_call_ai() to determine which approach is needed. The behavior should be: AI always called outside convergence, never called inside convergence.

### 7.2 What the AI Reviews

| Judgment                         | What AI Checks                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| U in typical range?              | Compare U_dirty against fluid-pair typical ranges (from book context)                                          |
| Resistance breakdown sensible?   | For oil/water, tube film + fouling should dominate. If wall is 40%, flag it.                                   |
| Controlling resistance expected? | Shell film for viscous shell-side, tube film for viscous tube-side                                             |
| Kern cross-check                 | If BD/Kern U deviation > 15%, note concern. > 25% → consider ESCALATE                                          |
| k_w source reliable?             | If stub default → WARN. If ASME → high confidence                                                              |
| CF reasonable?                   | < 0.65 → heavy fouling service, verify assumptions. > 0.95 → very clean, verify fouling factors aren't too low |
| U vs Step 6 estimate             | Large deviation signals iteration needed — note but don't escalate (Step 12 handles this)                      |

### 7.3 AI Can Correct

| Correction     | When                                                    | Effect                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tube material  | AI sees fluid is corrosive but k_w is carbon steel      | Changes `tube_material` + `k_wall_W_mK` → re-execute   |
| Fouling factor | AI sees fouling dominates but R_f seems low for service | Changes `R_f_hot_m2KW` or `R_f_cold_m2KW` → re-execute |

### 7.4 AI Step Prompt

Add to `_STEP_PROMPTS[9]` in `ai_engineer.py`:

```
You are reviewing Step 9: Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient.

This step aggregates all thermal resistances into the overall U value.
You are checking whether:
1. The calculated U falls within the typical range for this fluid pair
2. The resistance breakdown is physically sensible
3. The controlling resistance matches expectations for this service
4. The Bell-Delaware vs Kern deviation is acceptable
5. The tube material and wall conductivity are appropriate for the fluids

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT escalate because U differs from the Step 6 estimate.
  That deviation is expected and is handled by Step 12 convergence.
- Focus on whether the individual resistance values are physically reasonable.
- If wall resistance exceeds 10% and material is carbon steel, verify
  the service doesn't require an exotic alloy.
```

### 7.5 Step Context Builder

Add to `ai_engineer.py` `_build_step_context()`:

```python
if step.step_id == 9:
    u_est = state.U_W_m2K  # Step 6 estimate
    u_calc = result.outputs.get("U_dirty_W_m2K")
    parts = []
    if u_est and u_calc:
        dev = (u_calc - u_est) / u_est * 100
        parts.append(f"Step 6 estimated U: {u_est:.1f} W/m²K")
        parts.append(f"Deviation from estimate: {dev:+.1f}%")
    cf = result.outputs.get("cleanliness_factor")
    if cf:
        parts.append(f"Cleanliness factor: {cf:.3f}")
    ctrl = result.outputs.get("controlling_resistance")
    if ctrl:
        parts.append(f"Controlling resistance: {ctrl}")
    k_src = result.outputs.get("k_wall_source")
    if k_src:
        parts.append(f"Wall conductivity source: {k_src}")
    return "\n".join(parts)
```

---

## 8. Layer 4: State Update

### 8.1 Direct State Writes (in execute)

Step 9 writes material properties directly to state (same pattern as Step 8 writing h_shell):

```python
# In execute(), after material resolution:
state.tube_material = material_props.material_name
state.k_wall_W_mK = material_props.k_wall_W_mK
state.k_wall_source = material_props.source
state.k_wall_confidence = material_props.confidence
```

### 8.2 Output Mapping (in pipeline_runner)

The remaining outputs go through `_apply_outputs()` in pipeline_runner.py.

Add to the mapping dict:

```python
# Step 9 outputs
"U_clean_W_m2K": "U_clean_W_m2K",
"U_dirty_W_m2K": "U_dirty_W_m2K",
"U_overall_W_m2K": "U_overall_W_m2K",
"cleanliness_factor": "cleanliness_factor",
"resistance_breakdown": "resistance_breakdown",
"controlling_resistance": "controlling_resistance",
"U_kern_W_m2K": "U_kern_W_m2K",
"U_kern_deviation_pct": "U_kern_deviation_pct",
"U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct": "U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct",
```

---

## 9. Convergence Loop Behavior

### 9.1 During Step 12 Convergence (in_convergence_loop=True)

- `_should_call_ai()` or `_conditional_ai_trigger()` returns False
- Step 9 executes Layer 1 (pure math) only
- Layer 2 rules still checked
- No AI review — no 2-3s latency per iteration
- State is updated with new U values each iteration
- `k_wall_W_mK` is already on state from first iteration — NOT re-resolved

### 9.2 After Convergence (in_convergence_loop=False)

- AI is called with FULL review
- Sees the final converged U + resistance breakdown
- Can correct if needed (which would trigger another convergence cycle if in Step 12 scope)
- This is the AI's one chance to validate U — make it count

### 9.3 Material Resolution Optimization

```python
# In execute():
if state.k_wall_W_mK is not None:
    # Already resolved (from prior iteration or prior step)
    k_w = state.k_wall_W_mK
else:
    # First time — resolve via adapter
    material_props = await self._resolve_material(state)
    k_w = material_props.k_wall_W_mK
    # Write to state so convergence iterations skip this
    state.tube_material = material_props.material_name
    state.k_wall_W_mK = k_w
    state.k_wall_source = material_props.source
    state.k_wall_confidence = material_props.confidence
```

## 10. ht Library Usage

### 10.1 R_cylinder for Wall Resistance

The `ht` library (already installed, v1.2.0) provides `R_cylinder()`:

```python
from ht.conduction import R_cylinder

# R_cylinder(Di, Do, k, L) → thermal resistance [K/W] for unit length
R_wall_per_length = R_cylinder(d_i, d_o, k_w, L=1.0)
# = ln(d_o/d_i) / (2π × k_w) for L=1

# Convert to area-based resistance [m²·K/W] referenced to outer surface:
R_wall_area = d_o * math.log(d_o / d_i) / (2 * k_w)
```

**Note:** `R_cylinder` computes $\frac{\ln(D_o/D_i)}{2\pi k L}$ which is a total resistance in K/W. For the per-area resistance used in the U formula, we use the direct formula. `R_cylinder` serves as a cross-check:

```python
# Cross-check:
R_from_ht = R_cylinder(d_i, d_o, k_w, 1.0)  # K/W per meter length
R_from_formula = d_o * log(d_o / d_i) / (2 * k_w)  # m²·K/W per area
# Relationship: R_from_formula = R_from_ht × π × d_o  (they should match)
```

### 10.2 Why ht Over Manual Formula?

- `R_cylinder` is validated against Bergman/Incropera textbook
- Same ecosystem as `thermo` and `chemicals` (Caleb Bell)
- Already installed — no new dependency
- Provides a sanity check for our direct formula implementation

### 10.3 Implementation Strategy

Use the direct formula for the main calculation (it's what the engineering reference uses). Use `R_cylinder` as an assertion/cross-check in tests.

---

## 11. Kern Cross-Check U

### 11.1 When Available

Step 8 stores `h_shell_kern_W_m2K` if the Kern cross-check was computed. Step 9 uses it to compute a Kern-based overall U.

### 11.2 Calculation

Same formula as the main U, but with `h_shell_kern` replacing `h_shell`:

```python
if state.h_shell_kern_W_m2K is not None:
    h_o_kern = state.h_shell_kern_W_m2K
    R_shell_film_kern = 1.0 / h_o_kern
    total_dirty_kern = R_shell_film_kern + R_tube_film + R_shell_foul + R_tube_foul + R_wall
    U_kern = 1.0 / total_dirty_kern
    deviation_pct = abs(U_dirty - U_kern) / U_dirty * 100
```

### 11.3 Interpretation

| Deviation | Meaning                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 10%     | Good agreement — geometry is well-characterized                       |
| 10-20%    | Typical — Bell-Delaware accounts for bypass/leakage that Kern doesn't |
| 20-30%    | Notable — AI should flag this                                         |
| > 30%     | Suspicious — possible geometry error, AI should consider ESCALATE     |

## 15. AI Prompt Template

Full system prompt addition for Step 9 (added to `_STEP_PROMPTS[9]`):

```
Step 9: Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient + Resistance Breakdown

ROLE: You are reviewing the aggregation of all thermal resistances into
the overall U value. This is the critical checkpoint where Steps 7–8
film coefficients, Step 4 fouling factors, and tube wall conduction
combine into the design U.

FORMULA REVIEWED:
  1/U_o = 1/h_o + R_f,o + (d_o × ln(d_o/d_i))/(2×k_w) + R_f,i×(d_o/d_i) + (d_o/d_i)/h_i

KEY CHECKS:
1. Is U_dirty in the typical range for this fluid pair?
   - Water/water: 800–1500 W/m²K
   - Oil/water: 100–350 W/m²K
   - Gas/liquid: 20–250 W/m²K
   - Oil/oil: 60–150 W/m²K

2. Is the controlling resistance physically expected?
   - Viscous fluid side should dominate
   - Gas side should dominate for gas/liquid service
   - If wall resistance > 10%, verify material

3. Kern cross-check (if available):
   - < 15% deviation: normal
   - 15–25% deviation: WARN
   - > 25% deviation: consider ESCALATE

4. Cleanliness factor:
   - 0.80–0.95: typical
   - < 0.65: heavy fouling — verify assumptions
   - > 0.95: very clean — verify R_f not underestimated

5. Tube material: If k_wall_source is "stub_default", WARN that
   ASME-sourced data was unavailable.

DO NOT ESCALATE because U_dirty ≠ U_estimated (Step 6). That deviation
is normal and handled by Step 12 convergence. Only escalate if the
individual resistance values are physically unreasonable.

CORRECTIONS YOU CAN MAKE:
- Change tube_material if fluids suggest corrosion risk but carbon steel was used
- Adjust fouling factor if breakdown shows fouling is unreasonably high/low
- NOTE: Do not change h_tube or h_shell — those are Step 7/8 outputs

RESPOND WITH: {decision, confidence, reasoning, correction, user_summary}
```

## 16. Pipeline Runner Changes

### 16.1 Add Step to Pipeline

```python
from hx_engine.app.steps.step_09_overall_u import Step09OverallU

PIPELINE_STEPS = [
    Step01Requirements, Step02HeatDuty, Step03FluidProperties,
    Step04TEMAGeometry, Step05LMTD, Step06InitialU, Step07TubeSideH,
    Step08ShellSideH, Step09OverallU,     # <-- ADD
]
```

### 16.2 Add Output Mapping

Add to the `_apply_outputs` mapping dict:

```python
"U_clean_W_m2K": "U_clean_W_m2K",
"U_dirty_W_m2K": "U_dirty_W_m2K",
"U_overall_W_m2K": "U_overall_W_m2K",
"cleanliness_factor": "cleanliness_factor",
"resistance_breakdown": "resistance_breakdown",
"controlling_resistance": "controlling_resistance",
"U_kern_W_m2K": "U_kern_W_m2K",
"U_kern_deviation_pct": "U_kern_deviation_pct",
"U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct": "U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct",
```

**Note:** `tube_material`, `k_wall_W_mK`, `k_wall_source`, `k_wall_confidence` are written directly in `execute()` (same pattern as Step 8 writing h_shell fields directly).

| Case                         | Handling                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `d_o == d_i`                 | Precondition check: `tube_od > tube_id` required. `ln(d_o/d_i)` = 0 → zero wall resistance.                                 |
| `h_i` or `h_o` = 0           | Precondition check catches this (from Steps 7/8). Division by zero prevented.                                               |
| `R_f = 0`                    | Valid (perfectly clean service). U_clean == U_dirty. CF = 1.0.                                                              |
| Very high h (>50,000)        | Film resistance approaches zero. Other terms dominate. Physically valid for boiling/condensing (future).                    |
| Very low k_w (<10)           | Wall resistance becomes large. Warn if >15% of total. AI reviews.                                                           |
| `h_shell_kern = None`        | Skip Kern cross-check. Set `U_kern_W_m2K = None`. No error.                                                                 |
| `U_estimated = None`         | Skip deviation calculation. Set `U_vs_estimated_deviation_pct = None`.                                                      |
| Material lookup unavailable  | MaterialPropertyAdapter falls back to stub. `k_wall_source = "stub_default"`, `needs_ai_review = True`. AI flags in review. |
| Exotic material not in stubs | Default to carbon steel + WARNING. AI should catch material mismatch.                                                       |

## 19. Build Sequence

```
Phase 1: Foundation (can start immediately)
  1. Add DesignState fields (Step 9 outputs + material fields)
  2. Build MaterialPropertyAdapter (stub mode only)
  3. Unit test MaterialPropertyAdapter

Phase 2: Core Step (depends on Phase 1)
  4. Build step_09_overall_u.py (Layer 1 execute)
  5. Build step_09_rules.py (Layer 2 rules)
  6. Unit test Layer 1 (calculation correctness)
  7. Unit test Layer 2 (rule pass/fail)

Phase 3: Integration (depends on Phase 2)
  8. Add Step 9 to pipeline_runner.py (PIPELINE_STEPS + output mapping)
  9. Add AI prompt (_STEP_PROMPTS[9] + step context builder)
  10. Convergence behavior tests
  11. Run existing pipeline tests to verify no regression

**All steps can proceed now.**
