## 0. Current Implementation Status (May 2026)

> **IMPORTANT FOR AGENTS:** This section reflects the ACTUAL current state of the codebase as of May 2026. The build sequence (§14) and original plan were written prospectively. The actual implementation is substantially ahead of the documented plan. When there is a conflict between §14 and this section, **§0 wins**.

## 1. Vision & Problem Statement

### 1.1 What We Are Building

ARKEN AI is a conversational platform that designs industrial shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The user describes their problem in natural language ("Design a heat exchanger for cooling 50 kg/s of crude oil from 150°C to 90°C using cooling water at 30°C"). The system performs all engineering calculations, validates every result with AI engineering judgment, and returns a complete, fabrication-ready design with full transparency into the reasoning at every step.

### 1.2 This Is NOT a Chatbot

A chatbot retrieves and rephrases information. ARKEN is a **computational engineering platform with a conversational interface**. Behind the conversation sits a real calculation engine executing Bell-Delaware correlations, iterating on geometry, checking vibration safety, running ASME pressure vessel code, and estimating costs. The conversation is the front door (5% of value). The engineering engine is the product (80%). The optimization is the bonus (15%).

### 1.3 The Two Modes

- **Design Mode (Sizing):** User knows process conditions, system determines geometry. "What exchanger do I need?"
- **Rating Mode (Performance Check):** User knows process conditions AND geometry, system checks if it works. "Can this existing exchanger handle 20% more flow?"

### 1.4 What Goes In → What Comes Out

**Inputs (from user):**

- Fluid identities and compositions
- Flow rates (kg/s)
- Inlet/outlet temperatures (at least 3 of 4)
- (Optional) Pressures, material preferences, TEMA class, constraints

**Outputs (from system):**

- Complete geometry (shell, tubes, baffles)
- Thermal performance (U, Q, LMTD, overdesign)
- Pressure drops (tube-side and shell-side)
- Vibration safety assessment
- Mechanical design (wall thicknesses)
- Cost estimate
- Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) with breakdown
- Step-by-step reasoning for every decision

```

### 1.6 Target User & Narrowest Wedge

**Target user (refined, Office Hours 2026-03-19):** Any process engineer at a mid-size EPC or refinery blocked by the HTRI license bottleneck — either a junior engineer without a seat, or a senior engineer (15+ designs/year) for whom HTRI setup takes 1–2 hours even with full access. Both archetypes feel this pain. The senior engineer is the one with purchasing authority.

**The structural constraint:** A team of 15 engineers typically has 1–2 concurrent HTRI seats and 1 specialist who can operate it confidently. Designs pile up. Schedules slip. This is not a niche complaint — the HTRI concurrent-license model structurally guarantees this bottleneck at every mid-size firm.

**Narrowest wedge that's worth paying for today:** A complete 16-step first-pass design tool with confidence score and step-by-step reasoning for every decision. Engineers need the full audit trail — the number alone is not enough. A stripped-down sizing tool without the reasoning layer will not be trusted by a trained engineer.

### 1.7 Status Quo

Engineers use one or more of:

- **HTRI Xchanger Suite** — industry gold standard, ~$30k/yr, limited concurrent seats, steep learning curve (weeks of training), effectively black-box results
- **Excel + Serth/Kern textbooks** — common at smaller firms, fully manual, error-prone, no audit trail
- **Outsourcing to specialist consultants** — expensive, slow

**The bottleneck in practice:** When a junior or mid-level engineer needs a heat exchanger design, they (1) write up the process conditions, (2) wait for the HTRI specialist's calendar to open up, (3) the specialist runs HTRI and returns the result, (4) the engineer reviews the output. The bottleneck is step 2. Even senior engineers with HTRI access spend 1–2 hours on setup for a single case. ARKEN removes this bottleneck by giving any engineer a trusted first-pass in minutes.

### 1.8 Constraints

- Pre-product; no external users yet
- Calculation accuracy must match or approach HTRI/textbook benchmarks (Serth Example 5.1 ±5% on U, ±10% on dP)
- AI must be bounded (deterministic calc + rule safety net precedes AI review) — engineers will not trust an AI that controls the math
- ~~Phase 1: single-phase liquids only; two-phase deferred~~ **[UPDATED May 2026]** Condensation (shell-side or tube-side) is now supported via the Shah condensation correlation and incremental zone calculations. Evaporation/boiling remains deferred. `FluidProperties` carries `phase`, `quality`, `latent_heat_J_kg`, `T_sat_C`, `P_sat_Pa`, and `enthalpy_J_kg`. `DesignState` carries `hot_phase`/`cold_phase` ("condensing"|"evaporating"|"liquid"|"vapor") and `increment_results: list[IncrementResult]`.

### 1.9 Demand Evidence

_Not yet formally validated (pre-product)._ The strongest proxies are:

- **Industry insider signal:** Builder has direct domain experience observing this bottleneck in real EPC / refinery environments. Not a hypothetical.
- **Market structure signal:** The HTRI concurrent-license model (~$30k/yr) structurally guarantees this bottleneck at every mid-size firm. 1–2 seats for 15 engineers, 1 specialist. The constraint is not going away.
- **Plan iteration signal:** v8.0 of the master plan. Deep conviction, significant iteration over prior attempts. Not someone who just had the idea.

**Gap:** No direct user conversations yet. No one has been asked to pay.

**Assignment:** Before writing a single line of code, find one process engineer — someone from prior work, school, or industry contact — and ask them to walk through their last heat exchanger design. Listen. Don't pitch. Ask: "What took the longest?" "What would have made it faster?" "How did you check if the design was right?" If they say "I waited for the HTRI specialist" — get their email. They are the first beta user.

### 1.10 Premises

All confirmed:

1. Shell-and-tube heat exchangers are the right starting wedge (most common type in oil & gas / refining)
2. Process engineers will trust AI-assisted calculations for real designs, especially with full reasoning transparency
3. The conversational interface adds value over a traditional form (lower barrier to entry, better UX for experienced engineers)
4. B2B SaaS is the right initial model (vs. API-first for integrators)

**Additional premises confirmed in Office Hours session (2026-03-19):**

5. The HTRI license bottleneck is the primary pain — not HTRI's accuracy. Engineers trust HTRI's results; the problem is access and setup time.
6. Engineers will trust a first-pass tool if they can see every calculation step and the reasoning behind each decision. Transparency earns trust faster than claims of accuracy.
7. The full 16-step pipeline (confidence score + audit trail + AI review) is the minimum version worth paying for. A stripped-down sizing tool without the reasoning layer will not be trusted.
8. The right initial customer is a team (a firm), not an individual engineer paying out of pocket. The license bottleneck is an org-level problem that needs an org-level purchase.

### 1.11 Effort Estimate

**Estimated effort:** XL (human: ~6 months / CC: ~3 weeks). **Trust-Calibration-First** build sequence selected (Office Hours 2026-03-19) — see §1.12 and Decision Log §21 for rationale. This reorders the original 8-week plan without changing total scope: HTRI Comparison workflow moved from post-beta to Week 5, providing real accuracy validation mid-build.

### 1.12 Approaches Considered

**Original build-sequence approaches (v6.0 → v7.0):**

| Approach          | Description                                                                           | Rejected Because                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A**             | Full v6.0: 16-step pipeline + AI review + autoresearch, 8-week build, then find users | Demand validated at Week 8, not Week 1                                                                                         |
| **B — Ship Fast** | Minimal 10-day build: Steps 1–5 + simple UI, no AI review, no optimization            | Misses the 10× value prop; no confidence scoring, no audit trail, indistinguishable from a spreadsheet                         |
| **C — API-First** | REST API for integrators before building a UI                                         | No demand signal yet; API without a reference UI is hard to sell; B2B SaaS premise (#4 in §1.10) favors end-user product first |

**Office Hours approaches (2026-03-19) — Trust-Calibration-First selected:**

| Approach                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Status                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Build-First**                        | Complete all 16 steps end-to-end, then bring in beta users. Product is polished when engineers first see it.                                                   | Not selected — 8 weeks without a user feedback loop                                |
| **B — Trust-Calibration-First (selected)** | Build Steps 1–8, then HTRI Comparison workflow (Week 5), then Steps 9–16. Beta users compare ARKEN to their HTRI results while the product is being completed. | **Selected** — accuracy and demand validated mid-build, not post-build             |
| **C — Open Benchmark First**               | Publish Serth Example 5.1 validation results publicly before recruiting users. Let the benchmark recruit beta users.                                           | Not selected — distribution risk; doesn't demonstrate the conversational interface |

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

**Current flow (being removed):** Frontend → Backend → MCP Client (SSE) → MCP Servers → Calculation Engine
**New flow:** Frontend → Backend → HX Engine (direct HTTP REST / SSE streaming via nginx)

Three services, each its own Docker container, fronted by nginx reverse proxy [Decision CEO-1A]:

```
                          nginx (:80)
                           │
            ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
            │              │              │
Frontend (React/Vite)   Backend        HX Engine
  served as static      (FastAPI        (FastAPI
  assets via nginx       :8001)          :8100)

  1. POST /api/chat ──────────────────────────────►
     (user message)         │  Loop 1: Claude orchestration
                            │  Claude calls hx_design tool
                            │  POST /api/v1/hx/start ─────────────►
                            │           ◄── { session_id, stream_url }
  2. ◄── chat response ─────┘  tool_executions: [{ tool_name: "hx_design",
     (with tool_executions)         result: { session_id, stream_url } }]

  3. Frontend reads stream_url from tool_executions
     GET /api/v1/hx/design/{id}/stream ──────────────────────────►
     [EventSource via nginx proxy]   Loop 2: 16-step Bell-Delaware
     ◄── SSE events (step_started, step_approved, ..., design_complete)

                    ◄── POST /internal/design-complete
                    [HX Engine webhook on completion]
```

```
Infrastructure: MongoDB :27017, Redis :6379 (AOF persistence)
Reverse Proxy: nginx :80 (routes /api/v1/hx/ → HX Engine, everything else → Backend/Frontend)
```

**Key routing [Decision CEO-1A]:** nginx reverse proxy provides one public origin. Frontend constructs SSE URL from relative path: `${window.location.origin}${streamUrl}`. No cross-origin issues.

### 2.2 Architecture Principles

1. **Deterministic calculation** — All engineering math runs in pure Python functions. No AI in the calculation path.
2. **Bounded AI judgment** — AI reviews outputs but can only: proceed, correct a parameter, warn, or escalate. Cannot skip steps, override safety rules, or act without constraint.
3. **Hard rule safety net** — Engineering limits checked BEFORE AI review. AI cannot override these.
4. **User escalation** — When AI cannot resolve something, it pauses and asks the user. User is always the final authority.
5. **Full transparency** — Every step streams to the frontend. User sees what happened, why, and what was corrected.

### 2.3 Secrets Management [Decision CEO-2A]

- `.env` file for all secrets (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, INTERNAL_SECRET, HX_ENGINE_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI, REDIS_URL)
- `.env.example` committed with placeholder values
- `.env` in `.gitignore`
- docker-compose.yml references `env_file: .env`

## 3. The Four Layers

Every step in the 16-step pipeline passes through four layers:

### Layer 1: Step Executor

- **What:** Pure Python calculation for one step
- **Implementation:** 16 pure functions — no side effects, fully testable in isolation
- **Speed:** 1–50ms per step
- **Rule:** Reads from design_state, returns StepResult. Never modifies state directly.

### Layer 2: Validation Router (Hard Rules)

- **What:** Pass/fail engineering checks — runs BEFORE AI review
- **Implementation:** Pure Python rule functions, instant
- **Speed:** <1ms
- **Rule:** AI CANNOT override these. If F < 0.75, it fails regardless of what the AI thinks.
- **Examples:** `F_t >= 0.75`, `dP_tube < limit`, `velocity > 0.5 m/s`, `J_l > 0.40`

### Layer 3: AI Senior Engineer

- **What:** Reviews step output, applies engineering judgment, suggests corrections
- **Implementation:** Single Anthropic API call per review (NOT an agent — see Section 5)
- **Speed:** 1–3 seconds per call
- **Rule:** Can only do four things: proceed, correct, warn, escalate. Never modifies values directly — suggests corrections that Layer 1 re-executes.
- **Retry logic [Decision CEO-3A]:** Retry 2× with backoff on failure. If all 3 attempts fail → WARN + proceed with `ai_called=False`.

### Layer 4: Design State

- **What:** Shared Pydantic model that accumulates all outputs, corrections, warnings, review notes, and confidence scores across all 16 steps
- **Implementation:** Initialized from request, grows with each step, serialized to JSON for frontend
- **Speed:** Instant
- **Rule:** Every step reads from it and writes to it. By Step 16, it contains the complete design.

### How They Work Together (at every step):

```
Layer 1: execute_step(design_state) → StepResult
    ↓
Layer 2: validation_rules.check(step, result) → PASS/FAIL
    ↓ (if FAIL → retry with geometry fix, max 3 retries)
Layer 3: ai_engineer.review(step, result, design_state, context) → Decision
    ↓
    ├── PROCEED → commit to design_state, next step
    ├── CORRECT → apply correction, re-run Layer 1, verify
    ├── WARN → record warning, proceed
    └── ESCALATE → pause, ask user, resume after response
    ↓
Layer 4: design_state.update(step, result, review)
    ↓
Emit SSE event to frontend
```

### Complete 4-Layer Code Flow (Step 9 Example)

```python
# pipeline_runner.py — Step 9 showing all 4 layers orchestrated

async def run_step_9(design_state, ai_engineer, memory):

    # Layer 1: Execute pure calculation
    result = step09_overall_u.execute(design_state)

    # Layer 2: Hard rules check (AI CANNOT override)
    validation = validation_rules.check(step=9, result=result)
    if validation.fails:
        return handle_hard_failure(step=9, validation)

    # Layer 3 + 4: AI review via shared correction loop [Decision ENG-1A, ENG-1B]
    # Full loop logic lives in BaseStep.run_with_review_loop() — see §7.5.
    review = await self.run_with_review_loop(
        result, design_state, ai_engineer
    )

    design_state.update(step=9, result=result, review=review)
```

---

## 4. The Three Loops

### Loop 1: Backend Orchestration (existing, upgraded in Week 6)

- **Location:** `backend/app/services/orchestration_service.py`
- **Owner:** Claude LLM (decides what to do)
- **Purpose:** Conversational agent that picks the right tool based on user intent
- **Duration:** 10–60 seconds total
- **Parameters (unchanged):**
  - MAX_ITERATIONS: 10
  - MAX_TOOL_CALLS: 15
  - MAX_REPEATED_ERRORS: 3
  - Default model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  - Max tokens: 4096

**Current state (Weeks 1–5):** Plain streaming Claude, no tools, no agentic loop. The comment in `orchestration_service.py` says "When HX Engine tools become available, they will be added here." Do not add HX tool calls before Week 6 — the HX Engine pipeline must be accurate first (HTRI gate §15.8).

**Week 6 upgrade:** Promote to a proper agentic loop with tool support:

- Register `hx_design`, `hx_rate`, `hx_get_fluid_properties` as Claude tools (schema from `engine_client.py`)
- Claude decides intent — no frontend keyword matching or parallel requests
- Tool executor calls `engine_client.start_design()` → gets `{ session_id, stream_url }` → returns as tool result
- `process_message()` returns `tool_calls` list; `chat.py` maps it to `tool_executions` in the HTTP response
- Frontend reads `tool_executions`, finds `hx_design`, calls `connectStream(result.stream_url)`

**Critical rule:** The frontend NEVER calls `POST /api/v1/hx/start` directly. The only path from browser to HX Engine trigger is: chat message → Claude tool call → backend tool executor → HX Engine.

### Loop 2: HX Engine Step Pipeline (new)

- **Location:** `hx_engine/app/core/pipeline_runner.py`
- **Owner:** Deterministic Python code + AI reviewer
- **Purpose:** Execute 16-step HX design with AI review at every step
- **Duration:** 15–25 seconds
- **Key:** Steps always run in order 1→16. AI does NOT control the flow.
- **All 16 steps are fully implemented.** `PIPELINE_STEPS` in `pipeline_runner.py` contains all 16 steps. The docstring mentioning “5-step pipeline” is a known stale comment.

#### 4.1 Step 7 Velocity Auto-Restart

Before falling to RedesignDriver or user escalation, the pipeline tries to fix tube-side velocity violations autonomously:

```python
# pipeline_runner.py
MAX_VELOCITY_RESTARTS = 3  # attempts before escalating to RedesignDriver

# If Step 7 velocity < 0.5 m/s: double n_passes, re-run Steps 5–6 inline
# If Step 7 velocity > 3.0 m/s: halve n_passes, re-run Steps 5–6 inline
# After MAX_VELOCITY_RESTARTS exhausted → falls to RedesignDriver via DesignConstraintViolation
```

This is separate from the RedesignDriver loop. It runs entirely within Loop 2 before any redesign attempt counter is incremented.

#### 4.2 Step 10/11 Failure Routing

Step 10 (pressure drops / nozzle ρv²) and Step 11 (negative overdesign) failures are **not** surfaced to the user as escalations. Instead they raise `DesignConstraintViolation` which is caught by `pipeline_runner.py` and routed to the `RedesignDriver`:

```python
# pipeline_runner.py
try:
    result = step10.execute(state)
except DesignConstraintViolation as dcv:
    redesign_result = await RedesignDriver(state).run(dcv)
    state = redesign_result.final_state
    continue  # pipeline resumes from Step 10 with new geometry
```

Classification helpers:

- `_classify_step10_mechanical_failure(state, result)` — checks tube dP, shell dP, nozzle ρv²
- `_classify_step11_overdesign_failure(state, result)` — checks negative overdesign

#### 4.3 Escalation History

All pipeline escalations are tracked in `state.escalation_history: dict[str, list[dict]]`. The pipeline also detects termination intent via `is_termination_intent(user_message)` from `design_intent.py`.

#### 4.4 RedesignDriver (Sub-Loop within Loop 2) [NEW — Not in original plan]

- **Location:** `hx_engine/app/core/redesign_loop.py`
- **Class:** `RedesignDriver`
- **Trigger:** `DesignConstraintViolation` raised from Step 10 or Step 11
- **Purpose:** Autonomously mutate geometry until constraints are satisfied, without asking the user

```python
# redesign_loop.py key constants
MAX_REDESIGN_ATTEMPTS = 8
MAX_FALLBACK_ATTEMPTS = 2

# Legal levers (9 total)
LEGAL_LEVERS = [
    "n_passes", "tube_length_m", "tube_od_m", "pitch_layout",
    "baffle_cut", "baffle_spacing_m", "n_shells",
    "shell_passes", "multi_shell_arrangement"
]

# Ladder constants for deterministic fallback
_TUBE_LENGTHS_M = [1.83, 2.44, 3.05, 3.66, 4.88, 6.10]
_TUBE_ODS_M     = [0.01905, 0.02540, 0.03175]
_N_PASSES       = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
_BAFFLE_CUTS    = [0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35]
```

**Lever selection strategy:**

1. **AI-driven** (primary): asks AI to pick the best lever given the current constraint failure
2. **Deterministic fallback** (if AI unavailable or returns invalid lever): round-robin over 9 (lever, direction) pairs from `_FALLBACK_SEQUENCE`

**State tracking:** Each attempt is logged in `state.redesign_history: list[RedesignAttempt]`. The SSE stream emits `RedesignAttemptEvent` for each attempt.

**After `MAX_REDESIGN_ATTEMPTS` exhausted:** If no geometry satisfies constraints, RedesignDriver escalates to the user with the best-found geometry + failure reasons.

### Loop 3: Autoresearch Optimization

**Status: DEFERRED TO POST-BETA [Eng Review, 2026-03-21]**
See §20 P2 for implementation plan. Beta ships with Loop 1 + Loop 2 only.

- **Purpose:** Explore 200+ geometry variants, return Pareto front of cost/performance trade-offs.
- **Why deferred:** Core value is Loop 2 (accurate 16-step design). Autoresearch adds optimization on top. Better to validate Loop 2 accuracy with beta engineers first — optimization is only useful if the base calculation is trusted. Also avoids the GIL/ThreadPoolExecutor parallelism question until we have timing data from real Bell-Delaware builds.

### How They Nest:

```
User message
  ↓
LOOP 1 (Backend — Claude orchestration):
  Claude calls hx_get_fluid_properties → HX Engine (instant, no Loop 2)
  Claude calls hx_design → HX Engine → LOOP 2 runs (15-25 seconds)
  # hx_optimize → LOOP 3 (post-beta, not in 7-week beta build)
  Claude presents results to user
```

### Timing Expectations:

| Tool                      | Loop 2 Behavior             | Expected Time |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `hx_get_fluid_properties` | No loop, direct calculation | < 100ms       |
| `hx_suggest_geometry`     | No loop, heuristic lookup   | < 100ms       |
| `hx_design`               | Full 16-step + AI review    | 15–25 seconds |
| `hx_rate`                 | Steps 2-11 only (no sizing) | 5–15 seconds  |
| `hx_optimize`             | 200 experiments, Steps 7-11 | 30–60 seconds | **POST-BETA** |

## 5. The AI Senior Engineer

### 5.1 It Is a Single API Call, NOT an Agent

This is critical. The AI reviewer does NOT:

- Decide its own next action
- Call external tools or services
- Loop or iterate
- Have a multi-turn conversation

It IS:

- A single `client.messages.create()` call to the Anthropic API
- Prompt in (calculation result + context), JSON out (decision)
- Your code (`pipeline_runner.py`) controls the flow entirely

**Current model constants (ai_engineer.py):**

```python
_MODEL               = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
_TEMPERATURE         = 0.1
_MAX_TOKENS          = 1024
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7
```

**Skills-based prompt system [IMPLEMENTED — not in original plan]:**
Step-specific AI prompts are NOT inline Python strings. They live in:

```
hx_engine/app/skills/
    base.md                    ← shared base prompt (prompt injection mitigation included)
    step_02_heat_duty.md       ← Step 2 specific context
    step_03_fluid_props.md
    step_04_tema_geometry.md
    step_05_lmtd.md
    step_06_initial_u.md
    step_07_tube_side_h.md
    step_08_shell_side_h.md
    step_09_overall_u.md
    step_10_pressure_drops.md
    step_11_overdesign.md
    step_12_convergence.md
    step_13_vibration.md
    step_14_mechanical.md
    step_15_cost.md
    step_16_final_validation.md
```

`ai_engineer._build_system_prompt(step_id, step_name)` loads `base.md` + the appropriate `step_XX_*.md` file at review time. The `_SKILLS_DIR` path constant points to this directory.

Do NOT look for prompts in `core/prompts/engineer_review.txt` — that file is from the old architecture. The skills directory is the source of truth.

```python
# ai_engineer.py — the entire AI review mechanism
response = await client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
return json.loads(response.content[0].text)
```

### 5.2 Retry Logic [Decision CEO-3A]

```python
# ai_engineer.py
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        response = await client.messages.create(...)
        return json.loads(response.content[0].text)
    except (APIError, JSONDecodeError, TimeoutError) as e:
        if attempt < 2:
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # backoff: 1s, 2s
            continue
        # All 3 attempts failed
        return AIDecision(action="WARN", ai_called=False,
                         reasoning="AI review unavailable — proceeding with hard rules only")
```

- Claude refusal (no tool_use / garbled response) → treated as WARN, `ai_called=False`
- Rate limit (429) → retried with backoff, then WARN after 3 failures

### 5.3 The Four Decisions

| Decision     | Meaning                          | Action                            | User Sees                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **PROCEED**  | Correct and reasonable           | Commit to design state, next step | Green check + summary        |
| **CORRECT**  | Passes hard rules but suboptimal | Modify parameter, re-run step     | Wrench + before/after values |
| **WARN**     | Borderline but acceptable        | Record warning, proceed           | Yellow triangle + concern    |
| **ESCALATE** | Needs human judgment             | Pause, ask user                   | Red circle + question        |

### 5.4 Full Context Via Design State

Each AI review call receives the COMPLETE design_state — all outputs from all previous steps. By Step 9, the AI sees everything from Steps 1–8, including all corrections and warnings.

Additionally, a `review_notes` field carries forward key engineering observations:

```python
design_state["review_notes"] = [
    {
        "step": 3,
        "note": "Crude oil viscosity from thermo library was suspiciously low. Corrected 0.45→0.80 mPa·s. If actual crude is heavier, properties could shift significantly.",
        "affects_steps": [7, 8, 9, 12]
    },
    {
        "step": 8,
        "note": "Baffle clearance tightened to fix J_l. Watch shell-side dP at Step 10.",
        "affects_steps": [10, 12]
    },
]
```

Each note is 30–50 tokens. By Step 16, review_notes adds 300–800 tokens to the prompt (upper bound when all 16 steps add a note; typical is 300–500) — small cost for cross-step reasoning.

### 5.5 What the AI Review Prompt Contains

Every AI review call sends four sections:

1. **Calculation Result** — what Layer 1 just computed
2. **Book Context** — relevant paragraphs from Supermemory (books)
3. **Past Design Data** — similar past designs from Supermemory
4. **Full Design State** — all outputs + review_notes from all previous steps

Example prompt for Step 9:

```
You are a senior process engineer reviewing Step 9:
Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient.

CALCULATION RESULT:
  U_calculated = 378 W/m²K
  Resistance breakdown: shell_film 28%, tube_film 29%, ...
  Cross-check: Kern method U = 410 W/m²K (deviation: 8%)

BOOK REFERENCE (from Supermemory):
  "For crude oil / cooling water, typical U: 300-500 W/m²K"
  — Serth & Lestina, Table 3.5

PAST DESIGNS (from Supermemory):
  - Run #42: crude/water, Q=5800kW, U=365
  - Run #47: crude/water, Q=6500kW, U=412
  Average past U: 385 W/m²K

PREVIOUS REVIEW NOTES:
  Step 3: viscosity corrected (affects this step)
  Step 8: baffle clearance tightened

FULL DESIGN STATE:
  {complete JSON of all previous step outputs}

Respond with JSON: {decision, confidence, reasoning, correction, user_summary}
```

**Prompt injection mitigation [CEO Amendment]:** Add system-level instruction to `engineer_review.txt` that constrains the AI to only respond with the expected JSON schema and reject any embedded instructions in the design state or book context.

**Try-first instruction [Decision ENG-1A]:** `engineer_review.txt` must include this instruction before the JSON schema:

> "Before choosing `escalate`, attempt to resolve the issue using sound engineering judgment — apply the conservative standard, select the safer geometry, or use the TEMA default. Only choose `escalate` if you have genuinely exhausted all reasonable options and cannot proceed without user input. When you do escalate, populate `attempts`, `observation`, `recommendation`, and `options` so the user has full context."

**Confidence gate [Decision ENG-1B]:** After every AI review (initial + each correction re-review), check `confidence`. If `confidence < 0.70`, treat the decision as `escalate` regardless of what the AI returned. This prevents low-confidence corrections from silently degrading the design.

### 5.6 The AI Returns Structured JSON

**Actual format (as of May 2026):** `corrections` is an **array** (multiple corrections per decision), and `option_ratings` is added for engineering completeness.

**proceed / correct / warn:**

```json
{
  "decision": "proceed",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "reasoning": "U=378 within book range (300-500) and close to past avg (385). Kern deviation 8% is well within 15% threshold. Tube-side film controls at 29% — expected for crude oil.",
  "corrections": [],
  "observation": "Tube-side film resistance dominates at 29% — typical for crude oil service.",
  "recommendation": null,
  "options": [],
  "option_ratings": [],
  "user_summary": "Overall U = 378 W/m²K — consistent with past designs and reference data."
}
```

**correct (single correction example):**

```json
{
  "decision": "correct",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "reasoning": "J_l = 0.38 below correction threshold 0.45. Tightening baffle-tube clearance will improve leakage.",
  "corrections": [
    {
      "field": "geometry.baffle_spacing_m",
      "old_value": 0.2,
      "new_value": 0.15,
      "reason": "Reduce J_l leakage by tightening spacing"
    }
  ],
  "observation": "Low J_l indicates significant shell-to-baffle leakage.",
  "recommendation": "Tighten baffle spacing",
  "options": [],
  "option_ratings": []
}
```

**escalate** — extended payload required [Decision ENG-1A]:

```json
{
  "decision": "escalate",
  "confidence": 0.31,
  "reasoning": "Tried BEM and BEU configurations. Neither satisfies both ΔP and bundle fit constraints at 610mm shell.",
  "correction": null,
  "attempts": [
    "BEM (fixed tubesheet): shell-side ΔP = 0.82 bar, exceeds 0.70 bar limit",
    "BEU (U-tube): bundle diameter 632mm, exceeds 610mm shell ID"
  ],
  "observation": "610mm shell cannot accommodate the required tube count at acceptable pressure drop for either bundle type.",
  "recommendation": "Upsize to 762mm shell (next TEMA standard). Adds ~$3,200 to fabrication cost but satisfies both constraints.",
  "options": [
    "Proceed with 762mm shell (recommended)",
    "Keep 610mm shell and accept ΔP = 0.82 bar (above limit — requires sign-off)",
    "Reduce duty by splitting into two shells in series"
  ],
  "user_summary": "Cannot fit design in 610mm shell. Recommend upsizing to 762mm."
}
```

**Confidence gate [Decision ENG-1B]:** `pipeline_runner.py` checks `confidence` after every AI call. If `confidence < 0.70`, override the decision to `escalate` regardless of what the AI returned. Log `confidence_gate_triggered=True` in the step record.

### 5.7 Helper Function Contracts

These functions are called by `BaseStep.run_with_review_loop()` and must have stable contracts so all 16 steps behave consistently.

```python
def apply_correction(state: DesignState, correction: AICorrection) -> None:
    """
    Write AI-proposed correction values into DesignState.
    Only mutates fields listed in correction.affected_fields.
    Called AFTER snapshot_fields(), BEFORE re-running Layer 1.

    correction.affected_fields: list[str]  — e.g. ["shell_id_mm", "baffle_spacing_mm"]
    correction.values: dict[str, Any]       — new values keyed by field name
    """

def apply_user_response(state: DesignState, response: UserResponse) -> None:
    """
    Apply user's ESCALATED decision to DesignState.

    response.type:
      'accept'   — AI's recommendation accepted; apply correction.values to state
      'override' — user typed their own values; apply response.values to state
      'skip'     — user approves step as-is; no state mutation, just mark step reviewed

    After this call, pipeline_runner re-runs Layer 1 + Layer 2 + AI review [Decision ENG-2A].
    """

# DesignState methods (defined on the Pydantic model):
def snapshot_fields(self, field_names: list[str]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return {field: current_value} for the listed fields. Called before apply_correction."""

def restore(self, snapshot: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Write snapshot values back to DesignState fields. Called on Layer 2 hard fail."""
```

### 6.3 Complete Step-by-Step Protocol

#### Step 1: Gather Process Requirements

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called
- **Layer 1:** Extract structured data from request (fluids, temps, flows)
- **Layer 2:** Check all blocking inputs present (fluid names, 3+ temps, flow rates)
- **AI checks:** Are defaults reasonable? Should pressure be higher (phase change risk)? Industry-specific rules (TEMA Class R for refinery)?
- **Can correct:** Override default pressure, set TEMA class from context, flag ambiguous fluids
- **Escalates when:** Fluid identity ambiguous, less than 3 temperatures, flow rate missing
- **Corner cases:**
  - User says "oil" — could be crude, thermal, vegetable. AI must ask.
  - User provides temps in °F — system must handle unit conversion
  - User provides 4 temperatures that don't satisfy energy balance — flag error

#### Step 2: Calculate Heat Duty

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called only if anomaly
- **Layer 1:** Q = m × Cp × ΔT using thermo library for Cp. Calculate 4th temperature from energy balance.
- **Layer 2:** Q > 0, energy balance closure |Q_hot − Q_cold|/Q_hot < 1%, T_cold_out > T_cold_in, T_cold_out < T_hot_in
- **Local checks (trigger AI if fail):** Q seems unusually high/low for flow rate, Cp from library anomalous, T_cold_out very close to T_hot_in (tight approach)
- **Can correct:** Adjust Cp if library returns anomalous value
- **Corner cases:**
  - Very small ΔT (< 5°C) — LMTD will be tiny, huge area needed. Warn early.
  - Cp that varies dramatically across temperature range (heavy oil) — single-point Cp may be inadequate
  - User provides all 4 temperatures that don't balance — which one to recalculate?
  - Q = 0 (identical inlet/outlet temps) — reject with clear message
  - Phase change likely at atmospheric pressure — flag need for higher pressure input

#### Step 3: Collect Fluid Properties

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if property anomaly
- **Layer 1:** Call thermo/CoolProp/iapws for ρ, μ, k, Cp, σ at bulk average temperature
- **Layer 2:** All properties > 0, density 500–1500 kg/m³ (liquids), viscosity > 0
- **Local checks (trigger AI):** Viscosity outside typical range for fluid type, properties change dramatically inlet→outlet, Pr outside 0.5–2000
- **Can correct:** Override viscosity with industry value if library result clearly wrong, add Sieder-Tate wall correction if viscosity ratio large
- **Corner cases:**
  - Fluid not in thermo library database — must handle gracefully, suggest similar fluid
  - Mixture with unknown interaction parameters — warn about property uncertainty
  - Properties at conditions near critical point — libraries may give erratic results
  - Supercooled or superheated conditions — verify phase is as expected
  - User specifies "crude oil" without API gravity — assume medium (API 29) and flag
  - Water properties near 0°C or >100°C at atmospheric — check for phase change

#### Step 4: Select TEMA Type and Initial Geometry

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called
- **Layer 1:** Decision tree for TEMA type based on process conditions. Heuristic selection of tube OD, pitch, layout angle, passes, length, baffle cut.
- **Layer 2:** Selected geometry parameters within TEMA standards
- **AI checks:** TEMA type vs thermal expansion (ΔT > 50°C → floating head), tube allocation (fouling fluid tube-side), pitch angle (90° for cleaning), industry rules
- **Can correct:** Switch BEM→AES if expansion problematic, switch to square pitch if fouling, change tube allocation if high-pressure on wrong side
- **Escalates when:** Two TEMA types equally valid — present trade-offs to user
- **Corner cases:**
  - Very high pressure on one side (> 100 bar) — must go tube-side, consider type D head
  - Both fluids foul heavily — square pitch needed but cleaning access limited. Escalate.
  - Very small duty (< 50 kW) — standard TEMA sizes may be overkill. Consider hairpin.
  - Very large duty (> 50 MW) — may need multiple shells in series/parallel
  - Corrosive fluid — 316SS or titanium tubes, affects tube count tables
  - User specifies a TEMA type that conflicts with service (e.g., BEM with 80°C ΔT) — warn

#### Step 5: Determine LMTD and F-Factor

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if F < 0.85
- **Layer 1:** LMTD from 4 temperatures. R, P, F-factor from analytical expressions.
- **Layer 2:** F ≥ 0.75 (hard rule), LMTD > 0, R and P within valid domain
- **Local checks:** F < 0.85 (borderline), R > 4 (highly asymmetric)
- **Can correct:** Increment shell passes from 1→2 if F < 0.80. Warn about temperature cross risk.
- **Corner cases:**
  - F < 0.75 — HARD FAIL. Must increase shell passes. If still < 0.75 with 2 shells, need different approach.
  - Pure counter-current (F = 1.0) — only possible with 1 tube pass. Rare in practice.
  - Temperature cross (T_cold_out > T_hot_out) — F-factor formula may give imaginary result. Detect and handle.
  - R = 1.0 exactly — special case in F-factor formula (L'Hôpital's rule needed to avoid division by zero)
  - Very small LMTD (< 3°C) — huge area required. May not be economically viable. Warn.
  - ΔT1 = ΔT2 exactly — LMTD formula has 0/0. Use arithmetic mean instead.

#### Step 6: Estimate Initial U and Size

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if U outside typical range or past designs available
- **Layer 1:** Look up typical U for fluid pair. Compute A = Q/(U×F×LMTD). Compute N_tubes = A/(π×d_o×L). Look up shell diameter from TEMA tube count tables.
- **Layer 2:** U > 0, A > 0, tube count maps to a standard shell size
- **Can correct:** Use past design avg U instead of book midpoint. Adjust shell to next standard size if tube count between table entries.
- **Corner cases:**
  - Required tube count exceeds largest single shell — need shells in series or parallel
  - Tube count maps exactly between two standard shells — choose larger (conservative)
  - No past designs available for this fluid pair — fall back to book midpoint with wider uncertainty
  - Estimated area < 5 m² — very small exchanger, consider if shell-and-tube is the right type

#### Step 7: Tube-Side Heat Transfer Coefficient

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if velocity or Re problematic
- **Layer 1:** Compute velocity, Re, Pr. Select correlation (Gnielinski/Hausen/transition blend). Compute h_i.
- **Layer 2:** h_i > 0, velocity within physical bounds
- **Local checks:** Velocity < 0.8 m/s (fouling risk), velocity > 2.5 m/s (erosion risk), Re in transition zone (2300–10000)
- **Can correct:** Increase tube passes if velocity < 0.5 m/s, decrease if > 3.0 m/s
- **Convergence-loop aware:** Skip AI when `in_convergence_loop=True` [Decision 3A]
- **Corner cases:**
  - Laminar flow (Re < 2300) — Gnielinski invalid. Switch to Hausen/Sieder-Tate. Much lower h_i.
  - Transition flow (2300 < Re < 10000) — must blend laminar and turbulent. No single correlation is accurate.
  - Very viscous fluid (μ > 10 mPa·s) — Sieder-Tate wall correction becomes significant. Need wall temperature estimate.
  - Single tube pass with very low velocity — may need to reconsider geometry
  - Non-circular tubes (e.g., enhanced/finned) — standard correlations don't apply directly

#### Step 8: Shell-Side Heat Transfer Coefficient (Bell-Delaware)

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called (most complex calculation)
- **Layer 1:** Compute all geometric areas (cross-flow, leakage A_sb, A_tb, bypass A_bp). Compute ideal h. Compute 5 J-factors. h_o = h_ideal × J_c × J_l × J_b × J_s × J_r.
- **Layer 2:** h_o > 0, all J-factors in range (0.2–1.2)
- **review_protocol.py thresholds:**
  - J_l: warn_below 0.55, correct_below 0.45
  - J_b: warn_below 0.60, correct_below 0.50
  - J_c: warn_below 0.70, correct_below 0.60
  - Product J_c×J_l×J_b: warn_below 0.40, correct_below 0.30
- **AI checks:** Are J-factors physically reasonable? Does h_o make sense for this fluid? Cross-flow velocity vs vibration risk?
- **Can correct:** Tighten baffle-tube clearance (for J_l), add sealing strips (for J_b), adjust baffle cut (for J_c)
- **Corner cases:**
  - J_l < 0.3 — extreme leakage. May indicate wrong shell-to-baffle clearance or very small shell.
  - J_r < 0.6 — adverse temperature gradient in laminar flow. Consider turbulence promoters.
  - No tubes in window (NTIW) — J_c formula different. Must detect and handle.
  - Double-segmental baffles — Bell-Delaware needs modified geometric calculations
  - Baffle spacing < 0.2×D_s — unrealistically close, fabrication impossible
  - Baffle spacing > 1.0×D_s — very wide, poor shell-side distribution
  - Shell-side Reynolds < 100 — Bell-Delaware correlations may not be valid

#### Step 9: Overall U and Resistance Breakdown

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called
- **Layer 1:** 1/U = 1/h_o + R_f,o + t_w/k_w + R_f,i + (d_o/d_i)/h_i. Compute each resistance as percentage.
- **Layer 2:** U > 0, all resistances > 0, percentages sum to 100%
- **AI checks:** U in typical range? Resistance breakdown makes physical sense? Kern cross-check deviation < 15%? Controlling resistance identified correctly?
- **Can correct:** Flag if U far from expected — likely indicates a problem upstream
- **Corner cases:**
  - U_calculated very different from U_estimated (Step 6) — geometry is wrong size. Need significant iteration.
  - One resistance dominates at > 60% — design is severely limited by one factor
  - Fouling resistance > film resistance — over-fouled design, consider reducing fouling factor if plant data available
  - Kern vs Bell-Delaware deviation > 20% — unusual, investigate why (often a geometric parameter error)
  - Wall resistance > 10% — only happens with very thick walls or low-conductivity materials (titanium)

#### Step 10: Pressure Drops

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if margin < 15%
- **Layer 1:** Tube-side: Darcy-Weisbach + return losses (4 velocity heads/pass) + nozzle losses. Shell-side: Bell-Delaware dP method with R_l, R_b, R_s corrections.
- **Layer 2:** dP_tube < limit, dP_shell < limit, nozzle ρv² < 2230 kg/m·s² (liquid). Hard limits: dP_shell < 1.4 bar, dP_tube < 0.7 bar.
- **review_protocol.py:** If margin < 15% on either side → auto-correct before AI call
- **Convergence-loop aware:** Skip AI when `in_convergence_loop=True` [Decision 3A]
- **Can correct:** Increase baffle spacing if shell dP tight, reduce tube passes if tube dP tight
- **Corner cases:**
  - Nozzle pressure drop dominates (> 30% of total) — nozzles too small. Increase nozzle diameter.
  - Shell-side dP very low (< 10% of limit) — may indicate poor shell-side flow distribution
  - Tube-side dP very low with low velocity — consider increasing passes for better heat transfer
  - Two-phase flow — dP correlations completely different (Lockhart-Martinelli). Not applicable for Phase 1.
  - Very viscous fluid — dP dominated by friction, return losses negligible

#### Step 11: Area and Overdesign

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if overdesign outside 8–30%
- **Layer 1:** A_required = Q/(U_calc × F × LMTD). A_available = N_tubes × π × d_o × L_effective. Overdesign = (A_available − A_required)/A_required × 100%.
- **Layer 2:** Overdesign > −5% (not critically undersized). Hard fail: overdesign < 0%.
- **Target range:** 10–25% (ideal), 0–40% (acceptable)
- **Convergence-loop aware:** Skip AI when `in_convergence_loop=True` [Decision 3A]
- **Can correct:** Increase tube count/length if undersized, decrease if oversized
- **Corner cases:**
  - Overdesign > 50% — waste of money. Step 12 should reduce geometry.
  - Overdesign exactly 0% — no safety margin. Minimum 10% needed for fouling and uncertainty.
  - Negative overdesign after convergence — may need to jump to next standard shell size
  - Very high overdesign in rating mode — exchanger is oversized for current duty. Report but don't "fix."

#### Step 12: Geometry Iteration (Convergence Loop)

- **Tier:** NO AI — Pure convergence loop, too fast for AI latency
- **Layer 1:** Run Steps 7→11 in a tight loop. Adjust geometry based on constraint violations.
- **Convergence criteria:** |U_calc − U_assumed| ≤ tolerance (ΔU < 1%), overdesign 10–25%, all dP within limits, velocity in range
- **Max iterations:** 20
- **Adjustment priority:** Fix dP violations first → overdesign → velocity
- **Implementation [CG1A]:** try/finally flag reset ensures `in_convergence_loop` is always cleared:

```python
state = state.model_copy(update={"in_convergence_loop": True})
try:
    for iteration in range(1, 21):
        # run Steps 7–11 (no AI due to flag)
        ...
        if converged: break
finally:
    state = state.model_copy(update={"in_convergence_loop": False})
    # CG1A: resets even if exception raised mid-iteration
```

- **AI called ONLY if:** Loop fails to converge after 20 iterations. AI then analyzes why and suggests structural change (different TEMA type, different baffle type).
- **SSE:** Emits `iteration_progress` event each iteration.
- **Corner cases:**
  - Oscillation between two geometries (shell diameter up then down) — implement damping
  - Conflicting constraints (lower dP requires wider spacing, but wider spacing gives low h_o) — may need trade-off
  - Convergence to overdesign = 0% exactly — on the edge, may oscillate. Accept if stable for 3 iterations.
  - Very small shell (< 200mm) — tube count tables may not have exact match. Interpolate.
  - Tube count doesn't match TEMA table exactly — round to nearest table entry

#### Step 13: Vibration Check

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called (safety-critical)
- **Layer 1:** Natural frequency at each span. Cross-flow velocity at each baffle compartment. Check 5 mechanisms: fluidelastic instability (Connors), vortex shedding, turbulent buffeting, acoustic resonance (gas only), fluid-elastic whirling.
- **Layer 2:** u_cross/u_crit < 0.5 at every span (Connors criterion with safety factor)
- **AI checks:** All 5 mechanisms at every span. Inlet/outlet spans (longest) are most critical.
- **Can correct:** Reduce baffle spacing (shorter span = higher natural frequency), add intermediate supports, add impingement baffle at inlet
- **Escalates when:** Vibration fix conflicts with dP limit — present trade-off (rod baffles, helical baffles, or accept higher dP)
- **Corner cases:**
  - Gas service — acoustic resonance possible. Must check acoustic frequency vs vortex frequency.
  - Inlet span is 1.5× central span — most likely vibration failure location
  - U-tube bundle — natural frequency calculation different (different end conditions)
  - Frequency ratio 0.8–1.2 (lock-in zone) — even if velocity is below Connors threshold, resonance risk
  - Very long tubes (> 6m) with few baffles — may need intermediate supports
  - Two-phase flow — velocity varies dramatically along shell length. Check at every compartment.

#### Step 14: Mechanical Design Check

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if borderline thickness or high expansion
- **Layer 1:** ASME VIII tube thickness, shell thickness. Thermal expansion differential.
- **Layer 2:** Actual wall thickness ≥ minimum required. Expansion within tolerance for selected rear head type.
- **Can correct:** Change rear head type (BEM→AES) if expansion exceeds tolerance. Increase tube BWG if thickness borderline.
- **Corner cases:**
  - External pressure on tubes (shell-side pressure > tube-side) — different ASME formula
  - Very high pressure (> 100 bar) — may need special high-pressure closures (type D head)
  - Differential expansion > 5mm — U-tube or floating head mandatory
  - Corrosion allowance reduces effective thickness significantly for thin tubes
  - Tubesheet thickness not checked in Phase 1 — flag as limitation

#### Step 15: Cost Estimate

- **Tier:** CONDITIONAL — AI called if cost anomalous
- **Layer 1:** Turton correlations. CEPCI adjustment. Material and pressure correction factors.
- **Layer 2:** Cost > 0, cost per m² within reasonable range for material
- **CEPCI [CEO Amendment]:** Use 2026 index (~816), not "2024 ≈ 800". CEPCI_INDEX constant with `last_updated` timestamp; log warning if > 90 days old.
- **Can correct:** Verify CEPCI is current year, cross-check material factor
- **Corner cases:**
  - Exotic materials (titanium, Hastelloy) — material factor > 5×. Verify factor is correct for the specific alloy.
  - Very large area (> 1000 m²) — Turton correlation may extrapolate. Flag as approximate.
  - Very small area (< 10 m²) — minimum fabrication cost may dominate
  - Pressure factor for very high pressure designs can triple the cost
  - CEPCI index must be for the correct year — using old index underestimates cost

#### Step 16: Final Validation and Confidence

- **Tier:** FULL AI — Always called (final sign-off)
- **Layer 1:** Run all final checks. Compute confidence score.
- **Confidence Score [CEO-CP2]:**
  - `confidence_breakdown` dict with 3 keys:
    - `geometry_convergence`: float [0.0, 1.0]
    - `ai_agreement_rate`: float [0.0, 1.0]
    - `validation_passes`: float [0.0, 1.0]
  - `CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS` constant: equal weights 1/3 each [Decision CEO-7A], tunable
  - `confidence_score` = weighted sum of breakdown × weights
  - Both stored in DesignState and shown in DesignSummary card (breakdown expandable)
- **AI produces:**
  1. Confidence score via breakdown formula
  2. Plain-English summary of the design and trade-offs
  3. List of all assumptions made and their impact
  4. Recommendations if confidence < 0.80
- **Corner cases:**
  - Confidence < 0.70 — design may be unreliable. Strong warning to user.
  - Multiple corrections made — compound uncertainty. Reduce confidence.
  - Key input was assumed (viscosity, fouling factor) — note in assumptions list
  - Cross-method deviation > 15% but U in typical range — conflicting signals. AI must interpret.

    # Phase state (new — supports condensation and two-phase service)
    phase:            Optional[str]   = None  # "liquid" | "vapor" | "two_phase"
    quality:          Optional[float] = None  # 0.0–1.0, None for single-phase

    property_confidence: Optional[float] = None  # 0.0–1.0
```

**Key differences from original plan:**

- `name: str` field **removed** — `FluidProperties` is anonymous. Fluid names are on `DesignState` as `hot_fluid_name: Optional[str]` and `cold_fluid_name: Optional[str]`.
- All core properties changed from `float` to `Optional[float]` (populated incrementally).
- Phase-change fields added: `quality`, `enthalpy_J_kg`, `latent_heat_J_kg`, `T_sat_C`, `P_sat_Pa`.
- Provenance tracking added: `property_source`, `property_confidence`.
- Bounds updated: Pr range is `[0.001, 10000]` (broader than original `[0.5, 1000]`).

**Thermo adapter priority chain (5 tiers, as implemented):**

```
iapws (water/steam) → CoolProp → Petroleum correlations (Lee-Kesler/Beggs-Robinson/Cragoe)
  → Specialty fluids → thermo (Caleb Bell)
```

`thermo_adapter.get_saturation_props()` and `thermo_adapter.get_cp()` are the public API functions.
`_strip_phase_suffix()` cleans fluid names before lookup.

- `Field(default_factory=list)` used on all list fields to prevent mutable default sharing.
- `CalibrationKey.from_state(state)` uses `hot_fluid_name`/`cold_fluid_name` fields (not `shell_fluid.name` which no longer exists).
- `RedesignAttempt` is a sub-model from `redesign_loop.py` imported into `design_state.py`.

Each step's `run_step_N()` in `pipeline_runner.py` is now just:

1. Record `step_start_time = datetime.utcnow()`
2. Emit `step_started` SSE event (step_id, step_name)
3. Execute Layer 1 (`self.execute(state)`)
4. Check Layer 2 hard rules
5. Fetch Supermemory context
6. Call `review = await self.run_with_review_loop(result, state, ai_engineer, book_ctx, past_ctx)`
7. **Append StepRecord** [Eng Review — ownership specified here]:
   ```python
   record = StepRecord(
       step_id=step.step_id, step_name=step.step_name,
       result=result, timestamp=step_start_time,
       duration_ms=int((datetime.utcnow() - step_start_time).total_seconds() * 1000),
       ai_called=step._should_call_ai(state, result),
   )
   state = state.model_copy(update={"step_records": state.step_records + [record]})
   ```
8. Call `await session_store.heartbeat(session_id)` [CEO Review 3 — orphan detection]
9. Save updated state to Redis

### 9.1 Architecture

```
HX Engine (pipeline_runner)
  ├── Step 1 completes → emit SSE event → nginx proxy → Frontend renders
  ├── Step 2 completes → emit SSE event → nginx proxy → Frontend renders
  ├── Step 3 + AI correction → emit SSE event → Frontend shows correction
  ...
  └── Step 16 completes → emit final event → Frontend shows result
                        → webhook POST /internal/design-complete → Backend stores in MongoDB
```

**Two-step validation flow (`/requirements` → `/design`):**

  Response: {valid: true, token: "<HMAC>", warnings: [...]}
    OR     {valid: false, errors: [...]}

POST /api/v1/hx/design
  Body: {...same fields..., token: "<HMAC>"}  ← token is optional
  Response: {session_id, stream_url, token}
```

The HMAC token is signed with `HX_ENGINE_SECRET`. If provided on `/design`, the engine skips re-validation. If omitted, validation runs again inline.

## 11. Backend Changes

### 11.0 What Gets Removed (Extraction Plan)

**Entire directories to delete** (after HX Engine is working end-to-end, Checkpoint 6 passed):

| Directory/File                                | Reason                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp_process_server/`                         | MCP server — removed entirely               |
| `mcp_calculation_engine_server/`              | MCP wrapper — removed entirely              |
| `calculation_engine/`                         | Generic engine — replaced by `hx_engine/`   |
| `backend/app/core/mcp_client.py`              | Replaced by `engine_client.py`              |
| `backend/app/services/tool_registry.py`       | Tools auto-discovered from engine manifests |
| `backend/app/models/tool_metadata.py`         | Replaced by EngineToolDefinition            |
| `backend/app/core/policy_engine.py`           | MCP-era policy gating — removed             |
| `backend/app/services/context_manager.py`     | MCP-era context tracking — removed          |
| `backend/app/services/narrative_generator.py` | MCP-era narrative — removed                 |

**Extract before deleting `calculation_engine/`:**

| Source File                               | Lines | Destination                                      | Notes                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `core/equipment/simple/heat_exchanger.py` | 4,361 | `hx_engine/app/correlations/*.py` + `steps/*.py` | Split monolith into focused modules. Use line 1408+ as Bell-Delaware scaffold. |
| `core/data/hx_reference.py`               | ~500  | `hx_engine/app/data/*.py`                        | Split into tema_tables, fouling_factors, u_assumptions, tube_materials         |
| `core/equipment/simple/hx_ht_adapter.py`  | 1,110 | `hx_engine/app/adapters/ht_adapter.py`           | Remove EquipmentBase dependency, keep ht library wrappers                      |
| HX-related tests                          | ~300  | `hx_engine/tests/`                               | Adapt imports to new module structure                                          |

**Blocking dependency:** `calculation_engine/` code must be extracted to `correlations/*.py` + `steps/*.py` BEFORE Steps 6–9 can be built (Week 3). Do not delete originals until Checkpoint 6 passed.

### 11.1 Replace MCP with Engine Client

**Remove:** `backend/app/core/mcp_client.py`, `backend/app/services/tool_registry.py`, `backend/app/models/tool_metadata.py`
**Create:** `backend/app/core/engine_client.py`

```python
# engine_client.py — replaces mcp_client.py
class EquipmentEngineClient:
    """HTTP client for one engine (httpx.AsyncClient)"""
    async def connect(self):        # GET /health + GET /tools → cache tool list
    async def call_tool(self, tool, args):  # POST to tool.endpoint
    async def call_tool_streaming(self, tool, args):  # POST with SSE response
    async def health_check(self):   # GET /health

class EquipmentEngineRegistry:
    """Manages all engine connections"""
    async def initialize(self, configs):   # Connect all enabled engines
    def list_all_tools(self):              # Merge tools from all engines
    async def call_tool(self, name, args): # Route by tool name
    async def health_check_all(self):      # Check all engines
```

### 11.2 Files to Change

**Status as of 2026-03-26:** MCP is already gone. The backend is a clean FastAPI app (chat, auth, stream). The table below reflects what's already done vs what Week 6 must do.

### 11.3 Auth System [CEO-CP5]

Added in Week 6. All backend endpoints except `/health` and `POST /auth/login` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

- `backend/app/models/user.py` — User Pydantic model: id, email, hashed_password, org_id (nullable), created_at
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py` — POST /auth/login (email + password → JWT), GET /auth/me
- `backend/app/core/auth.py` — JWT issue/verify, `get_current_user` FastAPI dependency
- `backend/app/core/password.py` — bcrypt hash/verify
- `scripts/create_user.py` — Admin CLI: `python scripts/create_user.py --email eng@acme.com --password s3cret`
- No self-service signup for beta. Users created by admin script only.
- Frontend login screen: email + password form, stores JWT in localStorage, adds to all API requests.

## 12. Autoresearch — Loop 3

**Status: DEFERRED TO POST-BETA [Eng Review, 2026-03-21]**
Full implementation plan in §20 P2. This section is retained as the design spec for when it's built post-beta.

### 12.1 When It Runs

Only when user explicitly asks for optimization. NOT automatic after every design.

### 12.2 What It Does

Starts from the converged base design (Loop 2 result). Runs Steps 7→11 only (not full 16). Each experiment: ~50–200ms. Total: 200 experiments. Uses ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=16) [Decision 3R-3A]. Bell-Delaware is CPU-bound.

**Important [CEO Amendment]:** Experiments run in memory only — no Redis saves during sweep.

### 12.3 The Flow

1. Run 10 heuristic variations (no AI): vary tube passes, tube OD, pitch
2. Show Claude the 10 results + Pareto front
3. Claude proposes 5 targeted experiments
4. Run those 5 (no AI)
5. Show Claude updated Pareto front
6. Repeat until budget exhausted

Claude is called ~5–10 times total, not 200 times.

### 12.4 Geometry Proposer Fallback [Eng Decision 4]

- Claude returns malformed JSON → `_random_perturbations(best, n=10)` called
- Claude returns geometries failing CG3A validation → ValidationError caught, fallback triggered
- Happy path: valid proposals returned → CG3A validates each before use

### 12.5 Pareto Front

- X axis: cost_usd (thousands). Y axis: U_overall_W_m2K. Bubble size: dP_shell_Pa.
- Non-dominated set: minimize cost_usd + dP_shell_Pa, maximize U_overall.
- Only Pareto-dominant results saved (better on at least one metric, worse on none). Not all 200 experiments.

### 12.6 Corner Cases

- All 200 experiments worse than base design — return base design as best
- Pareto front has > 20 designs — cluster and return representative 5–10
- User's constraint changed during optimization — abort and restart
- Optimization finds design that violates vibration (not checked in Steps 7–11) — run Step 13 on Pareto front members before returning
- Claude proposes geometry outside TEMA standard sizes — reject, ask for standard sizes only
- Claude proposes same geometry it already tried — skip duplicate, count against budget
- User cancels mid-optimization — return current Pareto front (partial results). Note: current batch (~16 experiments in ThreadPoolExecutor) finishes before stopping; cancellation is not instant.

- Chat panel: 28% width, always visible during streaming. User can type follow-up questions while watching step progress.
- HX Progress panel: 72% width. Top: slim progress bar. Below: StepCards stream in, newest at bottom. Scroll-to-follow.
- Header: wordmark "ARKEN" left, login status right. Single-page app, no routing.
- Empty state (before first design): centered prompt in progress panel — "Describe your heat exchanger problem." + 2 example prompt chips.
- **InputBar disabled when any step is ESCALATED [Decision CEO-6A]** — prevents concurrent input confusion.
- **ChatWindow error state [CEO Frontend Amendment]** — show connection errors gracefully.

### 13.2 Progress Bar

Slim bar at top of HX Progress panel, visible only while a design is running:

### 13.3 MessageBubble Style (Engineering Terminal Aesthetic)

No rounded bubbles, no avatar icons. Precision terminal aesthetic:

- **User message:** right-aligned block, right-border accent line in `amber-500`.
- **AI response:** left-aligned block, left-border accent line in `blue-500`, starts with `▶ ARKEN —` label in muted text.
- Data values inline (temperatures, flows, coefficients) rendered in JetBrains Mono with backtick-style highlight: `` `342 W/m²K` ``
- No timestamps. No avatars. No hover reactions.

### 13.4 DesignSummary Card (Engineering Data Sheet)

Appears in HX Progress panel after Step 16 completes, above StepCards:

### 13.5 StepCard Interaction States

Each of the 16 StepCards has 7 states. Implement all 7 before shipping any card:

```
STATE       │ LEFT INDICATOR │ HEADER STYLE   │ BODY                    │ COLOR
────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼──────────────
PENDING     │ ○ (hollow)     │ muted text     │ —                       │ gray-400
RUNNING     │ ⟳ (spinning)   │ normal text    │ animated progress bar   │ blue-500
APPROVED    │ ✓ (solid)      │ bold text      │ AI reasoning (collapsed) │ green-600
CORRECTED   │ ↻ (arrows)     │ bold text      │ what changed + why      │ amber-600
WARNING     │ ⚠ (triangle)   │ bold text      │ warning message         │ yellow-500
ESCALATED   │ ? (question)   │ bold + italic  │ question to user + input │ orange-500
ERROR       │ ✗ (cross)      │ bold + strike  │ error message + retry    │ red-600
```

- CORRECTED: shows a diff — "Changed baffle_spacing from 0.20m → 0.15m because J_l was 0.38 (below 0.45 threshold)"
- ESCALATED: renders an inline response input within the card (no separate dialog)
- All states except PENDING show elapsed time in top-right: "[0.8s]"

### 13.6 AI Reasoning Display

- APPROVED cards: reasoning collapsed by default, expandable with "[→ view reasoning]" link
- CORRECTED/WARNING/ESCALATED cards: reasoning visible inline, no collapse (user must see why)
- Max 3 lines before truncation with "…show more"

### 13.7 IterationBadge (Step 12)

When Step 12 is RUNNING, the StepCard body shows:

```
  Convergence iteration  7 / 20
  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░   ΔU = 2.3%  (target: < 1%)
```

Badge animates each iteration. On converge: "✓ Converged in 9 iterations"

### 13.8 ParetoChart (Autoresearch)

**Status: DEFERRED TO POST-BETA [Eng Review, 2026-03-21]**
Component not built in 7-week beta. "Optimize for cost" button disabled with tooltip. Spec retained for post-beta implementation.

- X axis: cost_usd (thousands). Y axis: U_overall_W_m2K. Bubble size: dP_shell_Pa.
- Hover tooltip: shows all 3 values + geometry spec summary.
- Currently-selected design highlighted in blue. Pareto members in green. Dominated in gray.
- Empty state if < 2 Pareto members: "All variants performed similarly — showing best result."
- **Loading state [CEO Frontend Amendment]** — show spinner during optimization.

### 13.9 Design System

**Typography:**

- UI text: Inter (sans-serif), sizes: 12/14/16/20px
- Data values (temperatures, pressures, U, dP): JetBrains Mono (monospace) — signals precision
- Font weights: 400 (body), 500 (labels), 700 (step names, completion)

**Color Palette (engineering precision):**

- Background: `#0f1117` (near-black)
- Surface: `#1a1d27` (card background)
- Border: `#2a2d3a`
- Text primary: `#e8eaf0`
- Text muted: `#6b7280`
- Status: green `#22c55e`, amber `#f59e0b`, yellow `#eab308`, orange `#f97316`, red `#ef4444`, blue `#3b82f6`

**Spacing:** 4px base grid. Component padding: 16px. Card gap: 8px.

### 13.10 Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (≥1280px):** Split-panel as above.
- **Tablet (768–1279px):** Chat panel collapses to bottom sheet on tap. Progress fills full width. Chat toggle button in header.
- **Mobile (<768px):** Not a primary target (process engineers work at desks). Show a "best viewed on desktop" banner. Chat still usable, progress cards stack full-width.

### 13.11 Accessibility Baseline

- All StepCards have `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` so screen readers announce state changes.
- ESCALATED card input: `aria-label="Respond to step 8 question"`.
- Keyboard: Tab navigates to each expandable card, Enter/Space expands reasoning.
- Color contrast: all status colors on dark surface meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 min).
- Touch targets: Send button ≥ 44×44px. "View reasoning" link ≥ 44px height.

### 13.12 /btw Context Injection

**Status: DEFERRED to post-beta [CEO Review 3, 2026-03-21]**

`/btw` context injection has been removed from the beta build. Root cause: forward-only injection creates designs with internal inconsistency — `confidence_score` does not degrade when notes contradict already-completed steps. Post-beta implementation plan is in §20 P2.

## 14. Build Sequence (Week-by-Week)

### Week 1 — Foundation (Day-by-day order matters)

**Day 1 — Contracts (build nothing else until these are right)**

- `hx_engine/app/core/prompts/engineer_review.txt` — AI engineer system prompt + prompt injection mitigation [CEO Amendment]
- `hx_engine/app/core/exceptions.py` — CalculationError(step_id, message, cause)

**Day 4 — API endpoints**

- `hx_engine/app/routers/design.py` — POST /design → {session_id, stream_url (relative path), token}; GET /design/{id}/status [CG2A] + orphan detection; POST /design/{id}/respond [CEO Review 3 §7.12]
- `hx_engine/app/routers/stream.py` — GET /design/{id}/stream SSE [Decision 1B]
- `hx_engine/app/core/pipeline_runner.py` — Skeleton (runs 0 steps, just scaffolding) + `wait_for_user()` impl [CEO Review 3 §7.12]

**Day 5 — Backend + Frontend + Docker + nginx**

- `backend/app/core/engine_client.py` — Stub (real in Week 6)
- `backend/engines.yaml` — HX engine config
- `backend/app/config.py` — Add hx_engine_url
- Frontend: `npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts`, install deps

- `nginx.conf` — Routes /api/v1/hx/ → HX Engine [Decision CEO-1A]
- `.env.example` — All secret placeholders [Decision CEO-2A]

**Week 1 Tests (must pass before Week 2)**

- `tests/unit/models/test_design_state.py` — 12 tests for CG3A validators (all geometry fields: valid boundary, below-min raises ValueError, above-max raises ValueError, None accepted) + default_factory isolation test
- `tests/unit/test_step_protocol.py` — Protocol compliance check

---

### Week 2 — Steps 1–5 + Adapters

Build adapters FIRST (steps depend on them):

> **Pre-requisite:** Week 1 contracts (DesignState, StepResult, SSE events) must be finalized and passing 12 CG3A validator tests before starting Week 2. Adapter tests depend on FluidProperties schema from Day 1.

- `hx_engine/app/adapters/thermo_adapter.py` — Priority: iapws (water) → CoolProp → thermo. Returns FluidProperties in SI.
- `hx_engine/app/adapters/units_adapter.py` — All unit conversions to SI.
- `hx_engine/app/correlations/lmtd.py` — LMTD, F-factor (Bowman 1940 analytical)

Then steps:

- `step_01_requirements.py` — ai_mode=FULL. Parse raw_request → FluidProperties stubs.
- `step_02_heat_duty.py` — ai_mode=CONDITIONAL. Q = m_dot × cp × ΔT. Validation: Q > 0, < 500 MW.
- `step_03_fluid_props.py` — ai_mode=CONDITIONAL. ThermoAdapter for both fluids at mean T. Trigger AI if Pr outside [0.5, 1000].
- `step_04_tema_geometry.py` — ai_mode=FULL. Rule-based TEMA selection + initial geometry heuristics.
- `step_05_lmtd.py` — ai_mode=CONDITIONAL (F < 0.85). Hard fail F < 0.75 → retry with more passes.

**Week 2 Tests**

- `tests/unit/correlations/test_lmtd.py` — 6 cases incl. temperature cross detection, ΔT1=ΔT2 edge case
- `tests/unit/steps/test_step_02.py` through `test_step_05.py` — execute() + validation + conditional trigger
- `tests/unit/adapters/test_thermo_adapter.py` — Water at 25°C vs NIST
- `tests/integration/test_pipeline_steps_1_5.py` — Steps 1–5 with mock AI (always PROCEED)

---

### Week 3 — Steps 6–9: Bell-Delaware Core (GATE WEEK)

**DO THIS FIRST before Steps 6–9:**

- `hx_engine/app/correlations/bell_delaware.py` — Implement in isolation. Wrap in try/except for CalculationError.
- `tests/unit/correlations/test_bell_delaware.py` — Serth 5.1 benchmark test
- **Note:** Use existing `calculation_engine/core/equipment/simple/heat_exchanger.py:1408` as scaffold — extend J-factor rigour, don't start from scratch.

**Serth Example 5.1 reference geometry (must pass < 5% deviation):**

```
shell_diameter=0.5906m, tube_od=0.01905m, tube_id=0.01575m
tube_length=4.877m, baffle_spacing=0.127m, pitch_ratio=1.333
n_tubes=324, n_passes=2, triangular pitch, baffle_cut=0.25
Shell fluid: water at mean temperature
Expected: h_shell within 5% of Serth textbook answer
Expected: J_b, J_c, J_l each within 10% of Serth values
```

**If Serth validation fails, do not proceed to Steps 6–9. Debug bell_delaware.py first.**

**Bell-Delaware vs Kern auto-conservative rule [Decision 3R-7B, resolved CEO Review 3]:**
Add to `hx_engine/app/core/validation_rules.py` (used in Step 8 Layer 2):

```python
def check_bd_kern_divergence(bd_h: float, kern_h: float) -> AutoCorrectResult | None:
    """If BD/Kern divergence > 20%, return lower value as auto-correction. Layer 2 only."""
    if abs(bd_h - kern_h) / bd_h > 0.20:
        conservative = min(bd_h, kern_h)
        return AutoCorrectResult(
            use_value=conservative,
            reason=f"BD/Kern divergence {abs(bd_h-kern_h)/bd_h*100:.1f}% > 20% — using conservative lower value {conservative:.1f} W/m²K"
        )
    return None
```

Step 8 AI prompt receives both values + the override reason. AI annotates reasoning (which method likely under-predicts and why) — does not override the conservative choice.

Then:

- `hx_engine/app/correlations/gnielinski.py` — tube_side_h (turbulent, laminar, transition blend)
- `step_06_initial_u.py` — asyncio.gather books + past [9A] via \_safe_memory_call [CEO-4A]
- `step_07_tube_side_h.py` — ai_mode=CONDITIONAL, convergence-loop aware
- `step_08_shell_side_h.py` — ai_mode=FULL, calls bell_delaware.shell_side_h()
- `step_09_overall_u.py` — ai_mode=FULL, asyncio.gather books + past [9A] via \_safe_memory_call. **Calibration correction point [Decision OH-4A]:** After computing U_calculated, query `calibration_records` for CalibrationKey = (fluid_pair, tema_type, shell_diameter_class). If ≥ 5 comparisons exist, apply correction: `U_corrected = U_calculated × (1 - avg_delta_U_pct/100)`. Pass both U_calculated and U_corrected to AI review. AI reasoning shows: "Calibration factor applied: −8.2% from 7 HTRI comparisons (crude_oil/water, BEM, medium)." If < 5 comparisons, proceed without correction and note in AI reasoning.

**Week 3 Tests**

- `tests/ai/test_step08_reproducibility.py` [Decision 8A] — 10× identical Step 8 inputs, assert ≥ 9/10 same decision. Tagged `@pytest.mark.nightly`.
- `tests/unit/correlations/test_gnielinski.py` — 5 cases incl. turbulent water vs Dittus-Boelter crosscheck
- `tests/unit/steps/test_step_07.py` — verify AI skipped when in_convergence_loop=True

---

### Week 4 — Steps 10–12: Pressure Drops + Convergence Loop

- `step_10_pressure_drops.py` — Tube dP (Churchill friction) + bell_delaware.shell_side_dP(). Convergence-loop aware. Hard limits: dP_shell < 1.4 bar, dP_tube < 0.7 bar.
- `step_11_area_overdesign.py` — Overdesign check. Convergence-loop aware. Hard fail: overdesign < 0%.
- `step_12_convergence.py` — CG1A try/finally. Runs Steps 7–11 × max 20 iterations. Emits `iteration_progress` SSE. Convergence criterion: ΔU < 1%.

**Week 4 Tests**

- `tests/integration/test_convergence_loop.py`:
  1. Normal convergence → verify in_convergence_loop=False after
  2. Exception in iteration 5 → verify in_convergence_loop=False (finally works)
  3. 20-iteration limit hit → returns result with warning
  4. Steps 7/10/11 skip AI when in_convergence_loop=True
  5. Non-convergence (oscillating ΔU): 20 iterations hit, WARNING emitted, best result returned
- `tests/unit/steps/test_step_12.py` — try/finally specifically, using mock sub-step that raises on iteration 5

---

### Week 4 End — Pre-Week 5 Task (required before building HTRI parser)

**Before writing `htri_parser.py`:** Obtain 3 sample HTRI CSV exports from the beta engineer (ask during or after a call in Week 4). Validate: (a) column names are consistent across HTRI versions, (b) U_overall, dP_shell, dP_tube are present and labeled clearly, (c) identify any version-specific column name variations. If column names vary: build a column-name mapping table in `htri_parser.py` rather than hardcoded strings. [Decision CEO Review 3 — Open Q3 resolved: CSV first, .xrf post-beta]

---

### Week 5 — Steps 13–16: Vibration, Mechanical, Cost, Final Validation + HTRI Comparison Workflow

> **Trust-Calibration-First insertion [Decision OH-1A]:** The HTRI Comparison workflow (previously deferred to post-beta) is built in Week 5, immediately after the pipeline is complete. Recruit 1–2 beta users with HTRI access before this week. Their comparison runs validate ARKEN's accuracy mid-build, not after launch.

Pre-build:

- `hx_engine/app/correlations/connors.py` — connors_criterion() for Step 13
- `hx_engine/app/correlations/turton_cost.py` — Turton (2013) + CEPCI correction
- `hx_engine/app/data/cost_indices.py` — CEPCI_INDEX = {"value": 816.0, "year": 2026, "last_updated": "2026-03-01"} [CEO Amendment]

Then steps:

- `step_13_vibration.py` — ai_mode=FULL (safety). 5 mechanisms: Connors, vortex shedding, acoustic resonance, turbulent buffeting, jet impingement. Sets vibration_safe.
- `step_14_mechanical.py` — ASME VIII Div. 1 min wall thickness. ai_mode=CONDITIONAL (P > 30 bar).
- `step_15_cost.py` — Turton + CEPCI. ai_mode=CONDITIONAL. Check CEPCI last_updated, warn if > 90 days old.
- `step_16_final_validation.py` — ai_mode=FULL + asyncio.gather all 3 Supermemory sources via \_safe_memory_call. CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS constant (equal 0.25 each) [CEO-7A]. Save to past_designs if score ≥ 0.75.

**HTRI Comparison Workflow (moved from post-beta — [Decision OH-1A]):**
**MongoDB indexes (add at FastAPI lifespan startup, before any endpoint serves traffic) [CEO Review 3]:**

```python
# hx_engine/app/main.py — lifespan startup
await db.calibration_records.create_index(
    [("key", 1), ("archived", 1), ("model_version", 1)]
)
await db.users.create_index([("email", 1)], unique=True)
# Both are idempotent (MongoDB returns immediately if index exists)
# If creation fails: log CRITICAL, exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s, then re-raise → container restart
```

- `hx_engine/app/routers/htri_compare.py` — POST /api/v1/hx/compare endpoint. Request validated by `HTRICompareRequest` Pydantic model with physics-based bounds [OH-5A, Critical Gap B]:
  ```python
  class HTRICompareRequest(BaseModel):
      U_htri:        float = Field(..., gt=50,  lt=2000)  # W/m²K, typical S&T range
      dP_shell_htri: float = Field(..., ge=0,   lt=5.0)   # bar
      dP_tube_htri:  float = Field(..., ge=0,   lt=5.0)   # bar
  ```
  FastAPI returns 422 with field-level errors on invalid values. No bad data reaches the comparator.
- `hx_engine/app/services/htri_parser.py` — **CSV only in Week 5** [Decision CEO Review 3 — Open Q3]. Use `csv.reader()` (stdlib, no extra deps). Extract U_overall, dP_shell, dP_tube by column name (use mapping table from pre-Week 5 sample validation). 2MB file size enforced at endpoint before parser is called. Build after manual entry path is working. `.xrf` XML parser deferred to post-beta; when built, use `defusedxml` library (XXE mitigation).
- `hx_engine/app/services/htri_comparator.py` — Compute deviations (ARKEN vs HTRI): `delta_U = (U_arken - U_htri) / U_htri × 100%`. Store per CalibrationKey in `calibration_records` MongoDB collection [OH-7A]. Do not apply correction factor until ≥ 5 comparisons for that key. On successful store: update in-memory calibration cache [Critical Gap A — startup cache pattern, see below]. **Deviation sanity check before MongoDB write [Critical Gap B — second layer]:**

  ```python
  MAX_ALLOWED_DEVIATION_PCT = 50.0  # >50% means geometry mismatch or bug, not a calibration signal

  delta_U_pct = (U_arken - U_htri) / U_htri * 100

  if abs(delta_U_pct) > MAX_ALLOWED_DEVIATION_PCT:
      raise HTTPException(
          status_code=422,
          detail=f"Deviation {delta_U_pct:.1f}% exceeds 50% — verify inputs or contact support"
      )
  ```

  Pydantic catches format/range errors at the endpoint (layer 1). This check catches semantic errors inside the comparator — both U values in-range individually but deviation implausible, e.g. geometry inputs don't match the HTRI case (layer 2). Neither record reaches MongoDB.

- `hx_engine/app/data/calibration.py` — Calibration cache module. Loaded from MongoDB at HX Engine startup. Step 9 reads from this in-memory dict — MongoDB is never in the critical path during a live design run [Critical Gap A]:

  ```python
  # calibration.py — loaded once at startup, refreshed on each /compare submission
  CURRENT_MODEL_VERSION = "1.0"  # bump when Bell-Delaware implementation changes significantly

  _cache: dict[CalibrationKey, CalibrationRecord] = {}

  async def load_from_mongo(db):
      """Called once at startup via FastAPI lifespan. Populates _cache.
      Only loads active (non-archived) records matching the current model version.
      Archived records and records from prior model versions are excluded — they
      do not contribute to correction factors."""
      records = await db.calibration_records.find({
          "archived": False,
          "model_version": CURRENT_MODEL_VERSION,
      }).to_list(None)
      _cache.update({r["key"]: r for r in records})

  def get(key: CalibrationKey) -> CalibrationRecord | None:
      """Step 9 calls this. Always reads from memory — never hits MongoDB."""
      return _cache.get(key)

  def update(key: CalibrationKey, record: CalibrationRecord):
      """Called by htri_comparator after successful MongoDB write.
      Only called for non-archived records — bad data rejected before this point."""
      _cache[key] = record
  ```

  **Failure behaviour:** If MongoDB is down at startup, `_cache` stays empty → Step 9 proceeds without correction (logs WARNING). MongoDB going down mid-pipeline has zero impact on running designs.

  **CalibrationRecord schema (MongoDB document):**

  ```python
  # CalibrationKey — defined in hx_engine/app/data/calibration.py [Decision OH-6A, Eng Review]
  class CalibrationKey(BaseModel):
      """Compound lookup key for calibration records.
      All fields available from DesignState after Step 4 completes.
      fluid_pair is always sorted (alphabetical) so (crude_oil, water) == (water, crude_oil).
      """
      fluid_pair:           tuple[str, str]  # sorted alphabetically, e.g. ("cooling_water", "crude_oil")
      tema_type:            str              # e.g. "BEM", "BEU", "AES"
      shell_diameter_class: Literal["small", "medium", "large"]
      # small  = shell_diameter_m < 0.5
      # medium = 0.5 <= shell_diameter_m <= 1.0
      # large  = shell_diameter_m > 1.0

      @classmethod
      def from_state(cls, state: "DesignState") -> "CalibrationKey":
          fluids = tuple(sorted([state.shell_fluid.name, state.tube_fluid.name]))
          d = state.geometry.shell_diameter_m or 0
          diam_class = "small" if d < 0.5 else ("large" if d > 1.0 else "medium")
          return cls(fluid_pair=fluids, tema_type=state.tema_type or "unknown",
                     shell_diameter_class=diam_class)

  class CalibrationRecord(BaseModel):
      key:               CalibrationKey
      delta_U_pct:       float
      delta_dP_shell_pct: float
      delta_dP_tube_pct:  float
      comparison_count:  int
      last_updated:      datetime
      model_version:     str = CURRENT_MODEL_VERSION
      archived:          bool = False
      archived_reason:   str | None = None
      archived_at:       datetime | None = None
  ```

  Hard deletion is never used on calibration records. Soft archive (`archived: true`) is set via an admin endpoint when process conditions change or a Bell-Delaware bug fix makes old comparisons unrepresentative. TTL index (30 days) applied only to temporary design session documents, not to calibration records [Decision OH-9A].

- Frontend: HTRI comparison form on DesignSummary card (enabled only after Step 16 completes). Two input modes:
  - **Primary — Manual entry:** `U_htri`, `dP_shell_htri`, `dP_tube_htri` input fields. No file handling. Build this first. Fastest path to first calibration run.
  - **Secondary — File upload:** `.xrf` (XML) or CSV, 2MB hard limit (`File(..., max_size=2_000_000)`). Error message: "Export a single exchanger only — max 2MB." Build after manual entry is working.
  - Both modes show the same deviation table output: U, dP_shell, dP_tube, geometry fields side-by-side.

**Week 5 Tests**

- `tests/unit/correlations/test_connors.py` — safe, unsafe, near-threshold, missing fields
- `tests/unit/steps/test_step_13.py` — all 5 mechanisms; vibration_safe=False if any fails
- `tests/integration/test_pipeline_e2e.py` (first full run with mock AI):
  - Input: crude oil cooling request (fixed)
  - Assert: DesignState populated after Step 16
  - Assert: 0 < confidence_score ≤ 1
  - Assert: confidence_breakdown has 4 keys, CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS sum to 1.0
  - Assert: all 7 SSE event types emitted, design_complete last
- `tests/unit/services/test_htri_comparator.py` — deviation calculation, calibration record storage, minimum-5-comparisons gate, CalibrationKey compound key construction [OH-6A]; deviation > 50% raises 422 before MongoDB write [Critical Gap B layer 2]; archived records excluded from correction factor; model_version mismatch excludes record from cache load [OH-9A]
- `tests/unit/services/test_htri_parser.py` — **CSV only in Week 5** [CEO Review 3, .xrf deferred]: parse valid CSV with correct columns, missing required column raises ParseError with column name in message, empty CSV (headers only) raises ParseError, file > 2MB rejected before parser called [OH-8A], column name variations handled by mapping table (verify at least 2 variant names map to canonical names)
- `tests/integration/test_htri_compare_e2e.py` — end-to-end: POST /compare (manual entry) → compute deviation → store calibration record → verify MongoDB insert; POST /compare (file upload, valid .xrf) → same; POST /compare before Step 16 complete → 409; invalid token → 401 [OH-5A]
- `tests/unit/steps/test_step_09_calibration.py` — Step 9 with ≥5 calibration records: verify U_corrected applied; Step 9 with <5 records: verify U_calculated used unchanged; Step 9 with no records for key: verify proceeds without correction [OH-4A]

### Week 6 — Backend Integration + Frontend SSE Split + Auth

**Architectural decision [2026-03-26]:** The frontend NEVER calls the HX Engine directly or fires a parallel start-design request. The only entry point from the browser is `POST /api/chat`. The backend's Claude (Loop 1) decides whether the message is an HX design request and calls the `hx_design` tool if so. The tool result (session_id + stream_url) comes back in `tool_executions` on the chat response. The frontend reads that field and opens the SSE stream. Intent detection belongs to the LLM, not the frontend.

```
User message
  ↓
POST /api/chat  (single request — same as always)
  ↓
orchestration_service.py — Claude reads conversation + tool list
  Claude decides: calls hx_design({raw_request, user_id})
    ↓
  tool executor: POST /api/v1/hx/start → HX Engine
    ← { session_id, stream_url: "/api/v1/hx/design/{id}/stream" }
  Claude writes response: "Starting your 16-step design..."
  ↓
Chat response:
  { message: "...", tool_executions: [{ tool_name: "hx_design",
    result: { session_id, stream_url } }] }
  ↓
frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.jsx — after chat response received:
  finds tool_executions entry with tool_name === "hx_design"
  calls connectStream(result.stream_url)
  ↓
useHXStream → EventSource → nginx → HX Engine → HXPanel streams live
```

**What this means for the codebase:**

- `ChatPage.jsx` owns HX state (`useHXStream`). After each chat response, it scans `tool_executions` for `hx_design` and calls `connectStream`. No `onHXStart` prop, no parallel fetch, no frontend intent detection.
- `ChatPanel` / `ChatContainer` — no HX awareness at all. They only send chat messages and render responses.
- `backend/app/api/hx.py` — `POST /api/v1/hx/start` stays but is called only by the tool executor inside `orchestration_service.py`, never by the frontend.
- `stream_url` returned as a relative path (`/api/v1/hx/design/{id}/stream`). `useHXStream` prepends `window.location.origin`; nginx routes to HX Engine.

**Auth (CEO-CP5 — add first, everything else depends on it):**

- `backend/app/models/user.py` — User Pydantic model: id, email, hashed_password, org_id (nullable), created_at
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py` — POST /auth/login (email + password → JWT), GET /auth/me
- `backend/app/core/auth.py` — JWT issue/verify, `get_current_user` FastAPI dependency
- `backend/app/core/password.py` — bcrypt hash/verify
- `scripts/create_user.py` — Admin CLI: `python scripts/create_user.py --email eng@acme.com --password s3cret`
- No self-service signup for beta. Users created by admin script only.
- Frontend login screen: email + password form, stores JWT in localStorage, adds to all API requests.
- All backend endpoints except `/health` and `POST /auth/login` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**Backend:**

- `backend/app/core/engine_client.py` — Full implementation (was stub). HXEngineClient with `start_design()`, `rate()`, `optimize()`, `get_fluid_properties()`, `poll_status()`.
- `backend/app/api/hx.py` — `POST /api/v1/hx/start` endpoint. Called by the tool executor in `orchestration_service.py`. Returns `{ session_id, stream_url (relative path) }`. `raw_request` validated `min_length=1, max_length=5000`. Frontend never calls this directly.
- `backend/app/services/orchestration_service.py` — Upgraded from plain streaming to agentic loop with tool support. Registers `hx_design` (and later `hx_rate`, `hx_get_fluid_properties`) as Claude tools. Tool executor calls `engine_client.start_design()` when Claude invokes `hx_design`. Returns `tool_calls` list in the process_message result so `chat.py` can populate `tool_executions` in the response.
- `backend/app/dependencies.py` — `get_engine_client()` singleton (already exists).
- HX Engine webhook handler: `POST /internal/design-complete` → store result in MongoDB.

**Frontend:**

- `frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.jsx` — Owns `useHXStream`. After every `handleSendMessage` response, checks `response.tool_executions` for `tool_name === "hx_design"`. If found, calls `connectStream(execution.result.stream_url)`. Passes `error` from `useHXStream` to `HXPanel`. No `onHXStart` prop anywhere.
- `frontend/src/hooks/useHXStream.js` — Full SSE + 2s poll fallback [CG2A]. 8 event types. Exposes `error` state for SSE connection failures.
- `frontend/src/components/hx/HXPanel.jsx` — Accepts `error` prop; shows red banner when set.
- `frontend/src/components/hx/StepCard.jsx` — Live step card with status badge + AI reasoning.
- `frontend/src/components/hx/IterationBadge.jsx` — Step 12 convergence progress.
- `frontend/src/components/hx/DesignSummary.jsx` — With confidence_breakdown expandable.

**HX Engine — token security [Decision 3R-6A + CEO-5A]:**

- POST /design generates short-lived JWT (1hr, HX_ENGINE_SECRET). Payload includes user_id + session_id.
- GET /stream validates JWT: signature, expiry, user_id, session_id match. Unauthorized → 401.

**Week 6 Tests**

- `backend/tests/test_orchestration.py` [Decision 7A] — 5 golden cases (VCR cassettes for determinism):
  1. "Design crude oil cooler" → hx_get_fluid_properties → hx_design → tool_executions contains stream_url
  2. "Rate this exchanger [+geometry]" → hx_rate
  3. "Optimize for cost" (after design in session) → hx_optimize
  4. "Water properties at 80°C?" → hx_get_fluid_properties only
  5. "Same as last time but inlet 160°C" → hx_design with profile
- `backend/tests/test_hx_proxy.py` — Unit tests for `POST /api/v1/hx/start`:
  - Valid request → 200 + `{ session_id, stream_url }` where `stream_url` starts with `/api/v1/hx/`
  - Empty `raw_request` → 422 validation error
  - HX Engine unreachable → 502
- `tests/integration/test_sse_stream.py` — httpx AsyncClient, full SSE event sequence + JWT auth cases [Decision 3R-6A]:
  - No token → 401
  - Expired token (1s TTL) → 401
  - Wrong secret → 401
  - Token missing user_id claim → 401
  - Token with mismatched session_id → 401
  - Valid token with correct user_id and session_id → 200 + events

### Week 7 — DEFERRED (Autoresearch / Loop 3)

**Autoresearch deferred to post-beta [Eng Review, 2026-03-21].** The beta build is 6 weeks. Full autoresearch implementation plan in §20 P2. See §12 for the design spec.

**Beta build ends at Week 6. Ship checkpoint is Integration Checkpoint 6 (full system live).**

## 15. Test Plan

### 15.0 Test Infrastructure (conftest.py) [Eng Review]

Build `tests/conftest.py` in Week 1 Day 2, alongside the infrastructure files. All test files import fixtures from here — no local mock duplication.

```python
# tests/conftest.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
import fakeredis.aioredis

@pytest.fixture
def fake_redis():
    """In-memory Redis for all session_store tests. No network, no AOF."""
    return fakeredis.aioredis.FakeRedis()

@pytest.fixture
def mock_mongo():
    """mongomock motor client for calibration_records + users tests."""
    # use mongomock or motor AsyncMock depending on motor version
    ...

@pytest.fixture
def base_design_state():
    """Factory: returns a DesignState with required fields populated for step tests."""
    def _factory(**overrides):
        return DesignState(
            session_id="test-session-001",
            user_id="test-user-001",
            raw_request="Design a crude oil cooler",
            **overrides
        )
    return _factory

@pytest.fixture
def mock_ai_engineer():
    """Configurable AI engineer mock. Default: returns 'proceed' with confidence=0.85.
    Override per-test: mock_ai_engineer.review.return_value = AIReview(decision='correct', ...)
    """
    engineer = AsyncMock()
    engineer.review.return_value = AIReview(
        decision="proceed", confidence=0.85, reasoning="All checks pass."
    )
    return engineer

@pytest.fixture
def mock_supermemory():
    """All 5 Supermemory methods return empty strings (safe default for most tests)."""
    sm = AsyncMock()
    sm.search_books.return_value = ""
    sm.search_past_designs.return_value = ""
    sm.get_user_profile.return_value = ""
    sm.save_design.return_value = None
    sm.update_user_profile.return_value = None
    return sm
```

**Usage contract:** Import these fixtures in any test file that needs them. Never create local `AsyncMock()` versions of the AI engineer or Redis — always use these. This ensures consistent mock behavior across 20+ test files.

### 15.1 Affected Routes/Endpoints (nginx-proxied)

- POST /api/v1/hx/design — trigger design, returns {session_id, stream_url (relative path), token}
- GET /api/v1/hx/design/{session_id}/stream — SSE stream via nginx proxy
- GET /api/v1/hx/design/{session_id}/status — poll fallback when SSE disconnects [CG2A]
- POST /internal/design-complete — HX Engine webhook to backend (X-Internal-Token) [3R-1A]
- POST /api/v1/hx/rate — rate existing geometry
- POST /api/v1/hx/properties — fluid property lookup
- POST /api/v1/hx/optimize — autoresearch optimization [3R-3A]
- GET /health — health check (all 3 services via nginx)
- GET /api/v1/hx/tools — tool discovery endpoint (engine self-describes capabilities)
- POST /api/v1/hx/geometry — geometry suggestion/validation endpoint

### 15.2 Unit Tests (per step)

- Each of 16 step functions with known inputs → expected StepResult
- All input/output fields match Pydantic DesignState schema [Decision 2B]
- StepProtocol compliance: all 16 steps implement execute(DesignState) → StepResult [Decision 6A]
- AIMode enum: AIMode.FULL / CONDITIONAL / NONE — verify typo at import time raises AttributeError
- FluidProperties field validators: Pr in [0.5, 1000], phase in ["liquid", "gas"] [3R-4A]
  - Pr boundary: separate assertions for Pr=0.5 (pass), Pr=0.499 (fail), Pr=1000 (pass), Pr=1001 (fail)
- FluidProperties.name validator: non-empty string required — `FluidProperties(name="")` raises ValidationError
- StepRecord populated correctly after each step: ai_called flag, duration_ms > 0 [3R-5A]
- DesignState default_factory: `DesignState().step_records is not DesignState().step_records` → True

### 15.3 AI Engineer Tests [Decision CEO-3A — retry logic]

- Retry success on 3rd attempt: mock 2 failures then success → verify success returned, call_count == 3
- Retry exhausted: mock always fails → verify AIDecision(action='WARN', ai_called=False)
- Step 8 reproducibility: 10 identical runs → 9/10 same decision @pytest.mark.nightly [Decision 8A]
- PROCEED path: in-range inputs → proceed + confidence
- CORRECT path: low J_l (< 0.45) → correct + parameter change
- WARN path: borderline J_l (0.45–0.55) → warn decision
- ESCALATE path: ambiguous fluid name → escalate + question
- Claude refusal (no tool_use in response) → treated as WARN, ai_called=False
- Rate limit (429) → retried, then WARN after 3 failures
- AI response > 10 seconds: mock asyncio.sleep(11) inside AI call → verify timeout triggers retry [CEO-3A], after 3 timeouts → WARN + proceed with hard rules only

### 15.3b Correction Loop Tests [Decision ENG-1A, ENG-1B, ENG-2A]

**`tests/unit/steps/test_correction_loop.py`** — tests `BaseStep.run_with_review_loop()`:

- Proceed first try: mock AI → 'proceed' (confidence=0.85) → verify `step_approved` emitted, no correction_attempts
- Single correction + re-review: mock AI → 'correct' attempt 1, then 'proceed' → verify `step_corrected` emitted with attempts=[1 entry]
- 3 corrections exhausted [ENG-1A]: mock AI always 'correct' → verify force-escalate on attempt 3, `review.attempts` has 3 entries, `step_escalated` emitted
- **3 corrections exhausted + user response fails Layer 2 [CEO Review 3 gap fix]:** mock correction exhaustion → escalate → mock user response that still fails Layer 2 → verify `step_error` SSE emitted + `StepHardFailure` raised. Confirms the `else` branch in the correction-exhaustion path (not the direct-escalate path).
- Correction + Layer 2 hard fail → rollback: mock correction that causes validation fail → verify `state.shell_id_mm` restored to pre-correction value
- Confidence gate override [ENG-1B]: mock AI returns `decision='correct', confidence=0.65` → verify overridden to `decision='escalate'`, `confidence_gate_triggered=True` logged
- Confidence gate on re-review: mock AI proceed on attempt 1 but confidence=0.65 → verify force escalate even on 'proceed'
- Warn path: mock AI → 'warn' → verify `step_warning` emitted, no `wait_for_user` called
- Direct escalate: mock AI → 'escalate' → verify `wait_for_user` called exactly once
- **review_notes propagation [Eng Review]:** pre-populate `state.review_notes = ["[Step 7] Shell-side Re=650, baffle spacing sensitive"]` before calling `run_with_review_loop()` → verify that `ai_engineer.review()` is called with a `book_context` or `past_designs` string that contains the review note text (or that `_build_prompt()` embeds it — spy on `_build_prompt` if needed). Ensures review_notes reach the AI prompt and aren't silently dropped.

**`tests/unit/steps/test_apply_helpers.py`** — tests helper contracts from §5.7:

- `apply_correction` type='accept': verify `correction.values` written to DesignState fields
- `apply_user_response` type='accept': verify `correction.values` written to state
- `apply_user_response` type='override': verify `user_response.values` written to state (not correction.values)
- `apply_user_response` type='skip': verify state unchanged after call

**`tests/unit/steps/test_user_response_loop.py`** — tests ENG-2A post-escalation flow:

- User response → Layer 2 passes → `ai_engineer.review` called → `step_approved` emitted
- User response → Layer 2 fails → `step_escalated` emitted again (re-escalation 1)
- User response attempt 2 → Layer 2 passes → resolves
- 3 user attempts all fail Layer 2 → `step_error` SSE emitted + `StepHardFailure` raised, pipeline halts

**`tests/unit/models/test_design_state.py`** additions:

- `snapshot_fields(['shell_id_mm'])` returns `{'shell_id_mm': current_value}`
- `restore(snapshot)` after field mutation: original value restored
- `restore(snapshot)` after partial mutation: only snapshotted fields restored, other fields unchanged

### 15.4 JWT Stream Auth [Decision CEO-5A — user_id in token]

- No token → 401
- Expired token (manufactured with 1s TTL) → 401
- Token signed with wrong secret → 401
- Token missing user_id claim → 401
- Token with mismatched session_id → 401
- Valid token with correct user_id and session_id → 200 + events stream

### 15.5 Internal Webhook Auth [3R-1A]

- Missing X-Internal-Token header → 403
- Wrong token value → 403
- Correct token → 200, result stored in MongoDB

### 15.6 Webhook Retry [Eng Decision 2]

- Backend returns 500 three times → verify CRITICAL log, design still complete in Redis
- Backend down on first call, up on second → verify retry succeeds silently
- All 3 retries fail → result retrievable via GET /status for 24h

### 15.7 Bell-Delaware Accuracy (Week 3 — hard gate)

- Serth Example 5.1: U within 5%, all 5 J-factors within 10%, dP within 10%
- Run against implementation BEFORE wiring into Steps 6–9
- Note: use existing `calculation_engine/core/equipment/simple/heat_exchanger.py:1408` as scaffold
- **Bell-Delaware auto-conservative rule [CEO Review 3 — Decision 3R-7B resolved]:** test `check_bd_kern_divergence()` in isolation: (a) 10% divergence → None returned (no correction); (b) 25% divergence → AutoCorrectResult with `use_value = min(bd_h, kern_h)`; (c) Step 8 integration test: inject mock Kern result 30% below BD result → verify `h_o` in DesignState uses the lower Kern value + reason logged.

**Contingency path [Decision CEO-R-1A]:** If Serth 5.1 U misses ±5% after 3 days of iteration:

1. Activate Kern fallback — use simplified Kern correlation (Kern, _Process Heat Transfer_, 1950) for shell-side h in Step 8. Document the deviation in `bell_delaware.py` with a `# KERN_FALLBACK_ACTIVE` comment.
2. Proceed to Weeks 4-5 with Kern fallback active. Continue debugging Bell-Delaware in parallel as a background track.
3. Escalation: if Bell-Delaware remains unresolved after 3 days, ring-fence a week-long deep dive during Weeks 4-5 (does not block frontend/HTRI comparison work on separate tracks).
4. Do not proceed past Week 6 with Kern fallback active, as post-beta autoresearch will require accurate shell-side h.
5. Kern fallback is deactivated as soon as Bell-Delaware passes the Serth 5.1 gate.

### 15.8 Validation Rules

- All boundary values: F=0.75 (pass), F=0.74 (fail), velocity=0.5 (pass), velocity=0.499 (fail)
- LMTD edge: ΔT1 = ΔT2 → verify arithmetic mean, no divide-by-zero
- F-factor edge: R = 1.0 → verify L'Hôpital formula branch
- GeometrySpec validators: baffle_spacing_m < 0.05 → ValueError, > 2.0 → ValueError [CG3A]

### 15.9 Convergence Loop (Step 12)

- in_convergence_loop=True: verify Steps 7/10/11 skip conditional AI [Decision 3A]
- Loop terminates in < 20 iterations on standard case
- Exception in iteration 5 → in_convergence_loop=False via finally [CG1A]
- Non-convergence (oscillating ΔU): 20 iterations hit, WARNING emitted, best result returned
- Post-convergence AI review: after Step 12 converges, Steps 13–16 run with ai_mode=FULL (not CONDITIONAL) — verify AI is called in Step 13 and Step 16 even though in_convergence_loop was recently True
- Oscillation damping: mock ΔU that alternates [+5%, −4%, +3%, −2%…] → verify convergence detects damped oscillation and terminates early when amplitude < 1%, not after 20 iterations

### 15.10 Geometry Proposer Fallback [Eng Decision 4] — POST-BETA

**Deferred with autoresearch [Eng Review].** See §12 and §20 P2. Tests written when autoresearch is built.

### 15.12 Autoresearch Parallelism [3R-3A] — POST-BETA

**Deferred with autoresearch [Eng Review].** Note for post-beta: measure single Bell-Delaware + Gnielinski + dP call time before choosing ThreadPoolExecutor vs ProcessPoolExecutor. If pure Python math, ProcessPoolExecutor(8) for true CPU parallelism. See §20 P2.

### 15.13 Loop 1 Orchestration Regression [Decision 7A]

- "Design a crude oil cooler" → hx_get_fluid_properties → hx_design
- "Rate this existing exchanger [with geometry]" → hx_rate (not hx_design)
- "Optimize for cost" → hx_optimize (only after design exists in session)
- "What fluid properties does ethylene glycol have?" → hx_get_fluid_properties only
- "Same as last time but hotter inlet" → hx_design

### 15.14 Confidence Breakdown [CEO scope accepted]

- Step 16 populates all 3 keys: geometry_convergence, ai_agreement_rate, validation_passes — all floats in [0.0, 1.0]
- CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS sum to 1.0
- confidence_score == weighted sum of breakdown × weights (equal 1/3 each)
- confidence_score ∈ [0.0, 1.0] always

### 15.15 Redis / Session Store

- Keys expire after 24h (verify setex TTL)
- Key still present after 23h
- Redis connection lost mid-save → logged, pipeline continues
- AOF file written in docker volume (verify redis-data volume exists after restart)

**Orphan detection [CEO Review 3 + Eng Review]:**

- `is_orphaned()` — heartbeat < 120s ago → False
- `is_orphaned()` — heartbeat > 120s ago, `waiting_for_user=False` → True (normal orphan case)
- `is_orphaned()` — heartbeat > 200s ago, `waiting_for_user=True` → **False** (ESCALATED pipeline must NOT be marked dead; this is the critical regression guard)
- `is_orphaned()` — no heartbeat at all → False (just started, not orphaned)
- `heartbeat()` — updates `{session_id}:meta` key; verify TTL matches session TTL so both expire together

### 15.16 stream_url Format [Decision CEO-1A]

- POST /design returns stream_url as relative path string (not absolute URL with :8100)
- Frontend: `${window.location.origin}${streamUrl}` constructs valid EventSource URL
- nginx routes /api/v1/hx/ → HX Engine successfully

### 15.17 Edge Cases

- User disconnects mid-design: HX Engine completes, result stored for retrieval via poll
- Fluid not in thermo library: graceful error, suggest similar fluid
- Q = 0 (identical temps): reject at Step 2 with clear message
- F < 0.75 after shell pass increment: escalate, cannot resolve
- Step 12 doesn't converge in 20 iterations: return best result with convergence warning
- AI returns unknown decision type: treat as "proceed", log error
- Redis TTL expired mid-session: SSE stream → 404 on status poll, client shows error
- Internal webhook with missing/wrong token → 403, result not stored

### 15.18 Critical Paths (end-to-end must work)

1. Frontend → POST /design (nginx) → session_id + relative stream_url → EventSource → 16 steps → design_complete
2. Standard crude oil / cooling water design: convergence in < 25s, all events received
3. ~~Full autoresearch: 200 experiments in < 30s, Pareto front, vibration check on winners~~ **POST-BETA (deferred)**
4. Failed AI review with fallback: AI down → WARN cards → design completes with reduced confidence
5. SSE disconnect → poll fallback → reconnect on completion [CG2A]
6. Internal webhook failure → 3 retries → CRITICAL log → result retrievable via GET /status
7. SSE event-order verification: record all SSE events in order → assert `step_started(N)` before any terminal event for step N (`step_approved`/`step_corrected`/`step_warning`/`step_escalated`/`step_error`), all 16 steps present in order, `design_complete` is the final event, no terminal event for step N without a preceding `step_started(N)` [regression test; note: `step_started` is emitted by `pipeline_runner.py` before each step's execute(), not inside BaseStep]
8. Webhook happy path (full flow): HX Engine completes Step 16 → POST /internal/design-complete with X-Internal-Token → Backend stores result in MongoDB → GET /api/v1/hx/design/{session_id}/status returns complete result with all 16 step records

## 17. Drawback Mitigations

### 17.1 AI Inconsistency → Data-Driven Review Protocol

**Problem:** Same inputs can produce different AI decisions.
**Solution:** `review_protocol.py` defines explicit thresholds. Your code checks thresholds BEFORE calling AI. AI confirms corrections, doesn't decide them.

```python
STEP_8_CHECKS = {
    "J_l": {"warn_below": 0.55, "correct_below": 0.45},
    "J_b": {"warn_below": 0.60, "correct_below": 0.50},
    "h_o_range": {"min": 100, "max": 5000},
}
```

80% of decisions become perfectly reproducible (rule-based). AI handles only the 20% that genuinely needs judgment.

### 17.2 Lost Context → Review Notes Field

**Problem:** Each AI call is stateless. Earlier observations lost.
**Solution:** `review_notes: List[str]` in `DesignState` (added to §7.3). After each step's AI review, `run_with_review_loop()` appends the AI's observation (≤200 chars) as `"[Step N] {observation}"`. Passed to subsequent steps in the AI prompt context. Distinct from `warnings` (Layer 2 hard-rule violations). Example: `"[Step 8] Shell-side Re=650. Step 10 dP sensitive to baffle spacing."` — Step 10 AI receives this as additional context. [Wired in §7.5, Eng Review]

### 17.3 Accuracy Ceiling → Multi-Layer Calibration

**Problem:** Open-literature correlations may have systematic bias.
**Solution:**

1. **Cross-method:** Run Kern parallel with Bell-Delaware. Flag if deviation > 20%.
2. **Calibration factors:** Run 20–50 textbook examples, compute bias per correlation. Store in `calibration.py`.
3. **HTRI comparison:** Let users upload HTRI results. Accumulate correction factors per fluid pair. (Post-beta — see Section 20.)

### 17.4 Cold Start → Seed Design Database

**Problem:** First 10–20 designs have no past data.
**Solution:** Pre-seed with 100–200 synthetic designs from textbook examples. `scripts/seed_designs.py`.

### 17.5 Garbage In → Confidence-Gated Storage + Audit

**Problem:** Incorrect designs pollute Supermemory.
**Solution:**

1. Only store designs with confidence ≥ 0.75
2. Store confidence as metadata, AI weights results accordingly
3. Quarterly audit: re-evaluate old designs, flag > 20% deviation

### 17.6 Phase Change → Same Pipeline, Different Internals

**Problem:** Condensers/reboilers need different correlations.
**Solution:** Step functions dispatch based on `service_type`. Pipeline stays identical.

### 17.7 Prompt Quality → Data-Driven Prompt Builder

**Problem:** Bad prompts = bad reviews.
**Solution:** `review_protocol.py` defines checks declaratively. Prompt builder constructs AI prompt automatically from protocol. Engineering expert edits the dict, not prose.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Same fluid both sides (water/water)                          | Valid — common in HVAC. Process normally.                                    |
| Very high viscosity (> 100 mPa·s)                            | Laminar flow likely. Warn about poor heat transfer. Consider enhanced tubes. |
| Very low flow rate (< 0.1 kg/s)                              | Tiny exchanger. May not be practical as shell-and-tube. Suggest plate HX.    |
| Very high flow rate (> 500 kg/s)                             | Multiple shells likely needed. Flag in Step 6.                               |
| Temperatures in different units                              | Detect and convert. Always work in SI internally.                            |
| Negative gauge pressure (vacuum)                             | External pressure on tubes. Different ASME formula.                          |
| Supercritical fluid                                          | Properties change dramatically. CoolProp handles but warn about uncertainty. |
| User specifies impossible conditions (T_cold_out > T_hot_in) | Reject at Step 2 with clear explanation.                                     |
| User specifies 0 flow rate on one side                       | Reject at Step 1 — cannot design without flow on both sides.                 |

| LMTD formula ΔT1 = ΔT2                          | Use arithmetic mean (L'Hôpital's rule). Both code and tests must handle this. |
| F-factor formula R = 1.0                        | Special case — simplified formula. Must detect and use alternate expression.  |
| Re exactly 2300 or 10000                        | Transition boundary. Use blending function, not if/else discontinuity.        |
| Tube count not in TEMA table                    | Interpolate between nearest entries. Never extrapolate beyond table range.    |
| Zero fouling factor                             | Valid (clean service). R_f = 0 means no fouling resistance in series sum.     |
| Wall conductivity very high (copper: 385 W/mK)  | Wall resistance ≈ 0%. Valid but unusual for process HX.                       |
| Shell diameter < smallest in tube count table   | Design is too small for standard S&T. Suggest hairpin or plate.               |
| Degenerate geometry in autoresearch (n_tubes=0) | CalculationError caught, experiment skipped [CalculationError wrapper]        |

## 19. Extensibility

### 19.1 Adding New Equipment Types

1. Create microservice following `hx_engine/` pattern
2. Add entry to `engines.yaml`
3. Start service + restart backend
4. No backend code changes — tools auto-discovered

### 19.2 Engine Contract

Every engine must implement:

```
GET  /health              → {"status": "ok", "engine": "...", "version": "..."}
GET  /api/v1/{prefix}/tools → {"engine_id": "...", "tools": [...]}
POST /api/v1/{prefix}/{action} → JSON or SSE stream
```

### 19.3 Tool Naming Convention

- HX: `hx_design`, `hx_rate`, `hx_get_fluid_properties`, `hx_suggest_geometry`, `hx_optimize`
- Pump: `pump_design`, `pump_rate`, `pump_curve_lookup`
- Distillation: `distillation_design`, `distillation_rate`

## 20. Post-Development & Deferred Items

Items flagged during CEO review, eng review, and development planning that are **not** part of the 8-week build but must be addressed before or after launch.

### P1 — Before Public Launch

#### JWT httpOnly Cookie Migration

**What:** Migrate frontend JWT storage from `localStorage` to an `httpOnly` cookie set by the backend on `POST /auth/login`. The browser never reads the cookie via JavaScript — it's sent automatically on each request.
**Why:** `localStorage` is readable by any JavaScript on the page, including third-party scripts and XSS payloads. An `httpOnly` cookie is immune to XSS token theft. For beta with 5 trusted engineers this is acceptable risk; for public launch it is not.
**Depends on:** Week 6 JWT auth complete.
**Context:** Backend: `response.set_cookie('access_token', token, httponly=True, secure=True, samesite='lax')`. Frontend: remove `Authorization: Bearer` header injection, rely on cookie. All backend endpoints check cookie OR header during transition period.

#### Regulatory / Liability Stance

**What:** One-page internal document clarifying ARKEN's position on liability when designs are used in fabricated equipment. Determines disclaimer language and product positioning.
**Why:** Process engineers stamp and seal drawings. If ARKEN-designed equipment fails in service, the company needs a clear, intentional position. Decision needed before first paying customer.
**Depends on:** Legal counsel.
**Context:** If "decision support," results labeled "FOR REVIEW ONLY — verify with licensed engineer" and confidence score is a suggestion. If "fabrication-ready," higher accuracy bar with different exposure. This decision affects Step 16 output formatting, marketing, UX copy.

#### Pricing Model Decision

**What:** Decide the pricing model before building billing: usage-based (per design run), monthly seat, or annual seat.
**Why:** The auth layer (Week 6) will need billing hooks. Usage-based requires `design_count` field in user document + check in Step 16. Seat license requires `subscription_active` check at login.
**Depends on:** Ideally one conversation with a potential customer.
**Context:** For beta: "free for beta, decide before first paid user." Auth layer should support any model (add a subscription check function that returns True for all users in beta).
**Consequence if deferred past Week 6:** The auth layer ships without billing hooks. Retrofitting requires modifying the `get_current_user` dependency and every endpoint that checks subscription status. Cost: ~2 days rework. Acceptable for beta but creates tech debt.

### P2 — Post-Beta

#### HTRI Comparison Workflow

**Status: MOVED TO WEEK 5 [Decision OH-1A, 2026-03-19]**
**Why moved:** Originally deferred as post-beta. Office Hours session identified this as the single most important trust-building mechanism. Moving it to Week 5 means accuracy is validated by real engineers mid-build, not after launch. See §14 Week 5 for full implementation details.
**What remains post-beta:** Calibration factor dashboard (deviation trend over time). After ≥ 5 comparisons per fluid pair, correction factors are automatically applied in `calibration.py`.

#### PDF Export Report

**What:** "Export PDF" button on the DesignSummary card that generates a formatted engineering report: all 16 step outputs, AI reasoning, final geometry spec, confidence justification, disclaimer footer.
**Why:** Process engineers need to share designs with their team and file them in project records. A plain screen is not a deliverable.
**Depends on:** Step 16 complete (Week 5). Use `weasyprint` or `reportlab`.
**Details:** Font: use a serif body font (e.g. Noto Serif) for print readability, monospace for data tables. PDF bookmarks for each of the 16 steps so engineers can jump directly to a section. Footer: ARKEN logo + disclaimer + confidence_score + date. Page size: A4 (international standard for engineering docs).

#### CI/CD Pipeline

**What:** GitHub Actions CI with two jobs: (1) unit tests on every push, (2) nightly job running `@pytest.mark.nightly` tests (Step 8 AI reproducibility, Serth 5.1).
**Why:** Without CI, the Serth 5.1 hard gate is only enforced when someone remembers to run pytest manually.
**Depends on:** Week 1 complete.
**Priority:** Add before Week 3 Bell-Delaware gate.
**Commands:**

```bash
# Job 1 — on every push (fast, no AI calls)
pytest hx_engine/tests/ -m "not nightly" --tb=short -q
# Job 2 — nightly (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret)
pytest hx_engine/tests/ -m nightly --tb=long -v
```

#### TypeScript Type Generation from Pydantic Models

**What:** Auto-generate `frontend/src/types/hxEvents.ts` from `hx_engine/app/models/sse_events.py` using `datamodel-codegen` or `pydantic2ts`.
**Why:** `hxEvents.ts` manually mirrors `sse_events.py`. Every schema change must be updated by hand. Drift is silent.
**Depends on:** `sse_events.py` finalized (Day 1, Week 1). Run setup before Week 6.
**Command:**

```bash
# Using datamodel-codegen (preferred — handles Pydantic v2 natively)
datamodel-codegen --input hx_engine/app/models/sse_events.py --output frontend/src/types/hxEvents.ts --output-model-type typescript
# Add to pre-commit or CI to catch drift
```

#### Delete Decommissioned Code

**What:** Remove all MCP-era code: `mcp_calculation_engine_server/`, `mcp_process_server/`, `calculation_engine/` (sugar/adsorption/distillation modules), `backend/app/core/policy_engine.py`, `backend/app/services/context_manager.py`, `backend/app/services/narrative_generator.py`.
**Why:** Dead code accumulates confusion.
**Depends on:** Week 8 Checkpoint 6 passed (full system working). Run pytest after deletion.

#### Bell-Delaware CalculationError Wrapper

**What:** Add `CalculationError(step_id, message, cause)` exception class. Wrap `bell_delaware.shell_side_h()` and `shell_side_dP()` in try/except for ZeroDivisionError and ValueError from degenerate geometry inputs.
**Why:** CG3A validators prevent most degenerate geometries, but autoresearch proposes 200 variants including edge cases.
**Priority:** Build inline with Week 3 Bell-Delaware implementation.
**Test guidance:** Unit test with degenerate inputs (n_tubes=0, baffle_spacing=0, tube_od=tube_id) → verify CalculationError raised with correct step_id. Integration test in autoresearch: inject 1 degenerate geometry in 20 → verify it’s caught and excluded, other 19 complete.

#### Redis Mid-Pipeline Save Failure Handling

**What:** If Redis goes down mid-pipeline, emit WARN SSE event so user knows reconnect won't work. Catch `redis.ConnectionError` in `session_store.save()`.
**Why:** Without the WARN, user sees design_complete but gets 404 on reconnect.
**Priority:** Add after Week 2 infrastructure complete.
**Test methodology:** Use `fakeredis` or mock `session_store.save()` to raise `redis.ConnectionError` at Step 8. Verify: (1) WARN SSE event emitted with message containing "session may not be recoverable", (2) pipeline continues to Step 16, (3) design_complete event still fires.

#### CEPCI Index Maintenance

**What:** Staleness warning when CEPCI `last_updated` > 90 days old. Config constant in `data/cost_indices.py`.
**Why:** A 2-year-old index underestimates cost by 10–20%.
**Priority:** Build inline with Step 15 (Week 5). Update takes 2 minutes per quarter.
**Source:** Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index, published monthly in _Chemical Engineering_ magazine. Use official annual average. 2025 estimate: ~816. Fallback: interpolate from last 3 years if current year unavailable.

#### Autoresearch — Loop 3 [Eng Review — Deferred from Beta]

**Status: Post-beta [Eng Review, 2026-03-21]**
**Why deferred:** Core value is Loop 2 accuracy. Autoresearch adds optimization on top — only useful once engineers trust the base calculation (validated via HTRI comparison in Week 5). GIL/parallelism question also deferred until we have real Bell-Delaware timing data.

**Build sequence when ready:**

1. Measure a single Bell-Delaware + Gnielinski + dP calculation time on target hardware. If > 30ms, use `ProcessPoolExecutor(8)` for true CPU parallelism (not ThreadPoolExecutor). If < 30ms, ThreadPoolExecutor or sequential is fine (200 × 30ms = 6s).
2. `hx_engine/app/correlations/connors_prefilter.py` — `connors_quick_check()`: simplified natural frequency + gap velocity, ~10ms, returns False if stability_ratio < 0.8. Pre-screen variants before running full Steps 7–11.
3. `hx_engine/app/autoresearch/experiment_runner.py` — 200-variant sweep. Per variant: validate CG3A, run connors_quick_check(), run Steps 7–11 (no AI). Memory only — no Redis saves during sweep.
4. `hx_engine/app/autoresearch/geometry_proposer.py` — Claude analyzes 10 results, proposes 10 new GeometrySpecs. CG3A validates all proposals. Fallback: `_random_perturbations(best, n=10)`.
5. `hx_engine/app/autoresearch/pareto.py` — Non-dominated set: minimize cost_usd + dP_shell_Pa, maximize U_overall. If > 20 Pareto members, cluster to 5–10 representatives.
6. Run Step 13 (vibration) on all Pareto front members before returning — autoresearch only runs Steps 7–11, not 13.
7. `POST /api/v1/hx/optimize` endpoint + `frontend/src/components/HXProgress/ParetoChart.tsx`

**Tests:** §15.11, §15.12 (marked post-beta) — activate when building.
**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~3 hours)
**Depends on:** Beta complete + HTRI comparison validation showing Loop 2 accuracy is trusted.

#### /btw Context Injection [CEO Review 3 — Deferred from Beta]

**Status: Post-beta [CEO-R-7A, 2026-03-21]**
**Root cause for deferral:** Forward-only /btw creates designs with internal inconsistency — `confidence_score` does not degrade when a context note contradicts already-completed steps. Injecting "fouling factor = 0.0003" at Step 12 means Steps 1–11 are now calculated with the wrong fouling assumption, but their confidence scores remain untouched. This is a silent correctness gap.

**Post-beta build sequence (two phases):**

**Phase 1 — Pre-run notes only (no pipeline changes needed)**

- Scope: `/btw` only accepted before `POST /api/v1/hx/design` is called (i.e., before the pipeline starts).
- Notes stored as `applied_from_step=1` — injected at every step from the beginning.
- No confidence gap: all 16 steps see the note from the start. Internal consistency maintained.
- Implementation: `ContextNote` model in `DesignState`, stored in a separate Redis list key `{session_id}:context_notes` (avoids race condition with pipeline read-modify-write on main state key). Prompt injection in `BaseStep._build_prompt()`.
- Frontend: detect `/btw` prefix in `MessageInput.jsx`; disable during active pipeline with tooltip "Pipeline running — add context before starting your next design".
- SSE: add `context_note_ack` as the 9th event type (removed in beta, restored here).
- Prompt injection mitigation: strip lines beginning with "Ignore", "Disregard", "System:", "Assistant:" before injection.

**Phase 2 — Mid-pipeline injection (v2, requires parameter dependency graph)**

- Scope: `/btw` accepted at any point, including mid-pipeline.
- Requires: parameter dependency graph (which steps depend on which DesignState fields). When a note changes a field touched by already-completed steps, those steps are flagged for re-run. confidence_score degraded for affected steps.
- Alternative to full re-run: emit `step_warning` SSE with message "Context note may affect steps 3, 7, 9 — confidence adjusted" and degrade those steps' scores by a fixed factor (e.g., 0.85× per contradicted step).
- This is the architecturally clean version but requires significant DesignState graph metadata. Do not ship Phase 2 without a complete solution — partial mid-pipeline injection without confidence tracking is worse than Phase 1.

**Effort:** Phase 1 — S (human: ~1 day / CC: ~30 min). Phase 2 — L (human: ~1 week / CC: ~3 hours).
**Depends on:** Beta complete + at least 3 beta engineers using pre-run notes (Phase 1) to validate demand for mid-pipeline injection before building Phase 2.

Rationale: validates accuracy with real engineers mid-build, not after launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| OH-2A | Target user refined        | Both junior engineers (no HTRI seat) and senior engineers (15+ designs/year, HTRI too slow for first-pass) are primary users. Senior engineer has purchasing authority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| OH-3A | Org-level sale             | Initial customer is a firm (team license), not an individual. HTRI bottleneck is structural — org-level pain needs org-level purchase. Shapes pricing model decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OH-4A | Calibration feedback point | Correction factors from HTRI comparisons applied in Step 9 (Overall U) only. Single application point: U_corrected = U_calculated × (1 − avg_delta_U_pct/100). Applied only when ≥ 5 comparisons exist for the CalibrationKey. Shown in AI reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OH-5A | HTRI compare auth (Week 5) | Static `X-Compare-Token` bearer token on POST /api/v1/hx/compare during Week 5. Value in `.env` as `HTRI_COMPARE_TOKEN`. **Week 6 cutover:** Replace with JWT (same auth as all other protected endpoints). No dual-auth transition needed for beta (2–3 known engineers). Notify beta engineers directly when Week 6 ships. Add test: old X-Compare-Token on /compare → 401 after JWT cutover. [Eng Review]                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| OH-6A | CalibrationKey schema      | Compound key: (fluid_pair: tuple[str,str] sorted, tema_type: str, shell_diameter_class: 'small'\|'medium'\|'large'). Small < 0.5m, medium 0.5–1.0m, large > 1.0m. All fields available from DesignState after Step 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| OH-7A | Calibration persistence    | `calibration_records` MongoDB collection. Schema: {key: CalibrationKey, delta_U_pct: float, delta_dP_shell_pct: float, delta_dP_tube_pct: float, comparison_count: int, last_updated: datetime, archived: bool, archived_reason: str\|None, archived_at: datetime\|None, model_version: str}. `calibration.py` is a query module, not a data store. Startup cache only loads `archived: false` records matching `CURRENT_MODEL_VERSION`.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| OH-9A | Calibration data lifecycle | Three mechanisms: (1) Soft archive — never hard-delete calibration records; set `archived: true` via admin endpoint when process conditions change or a Bell-Delaware bug is fixed. Step 9 and startup cache ignore archived records. (2) Model version tag — bump `CURRENT_MODEL_VERSION` constant when Bell-Delaware implementation changes significantly; old records excluded from correction factor automatically. (3) TTL on session data — 30-day TTL index on any temporary design session documents in MongoDB (not calibration records). Hard deletion only for throwaway data, never for comparison records. |
| OH-8A | HTRI compare input modes   | Two input paths: (1) Manual entry — U_htri, dP_shell_htri, dP_tube_htri fields (primary, build first); (2) File upload — .xrf XML or CSV, 2MB hard limit (secondary, build after manual).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### CEO Review 2 — SELECTIVE EXPANSION (2026-03-20)

| ID       | Decision                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CEO-R-1A | Bell-Delaware contingency   | If Serth 5.1 misses ±5% after 3-day debug budget: activate Kern fallback (Kern, _Process Heat Transfer_, 1950) for shell-side h in Step 8. Proceed to Weeks 4-5 with Kern active. Escalate to week-long parallel deep dive if unresolved after 3 days. Bell-Delaware must pass before Week 7 autoresearch gate. |
| CEO-R-2A | Regulatory/liability stance | "Decision support" for beta. All Step 16 output and frontend copy labeled `FOR REVIEW ONLY — verify with licensed engineer`. Confidence score is a suggestion, not a certification. Revisit "fabrication-ready" post first 10+ HTRI comparisons.                                                                |
| CEO-R-3A | Pricing model               | Org/team seat license. Week 6 auth builds `subscription_active` per `org_id`; returns `True` for all beta users. If Week 6 slips, beta users default to `subscription_active=True` — no blocking.                                                                                                               |
| CEO-R-4A | Post-beta GTM path          | Three-step path: (1) first HTRI comparison < 10% deviation → ask engineer to show a colleague, (2) 2–3 engineers at one firm → org-level demo, (3) firm asks for > 2 seats → paid conversion trigger.                                                                                                           |

### CEO Review 3 — HOLD SCOPE (2026-03-21)

| ID        | Decision                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CEO-R-5A  | HTRI file format: CSV first             | `htri_parser.py` Week 5 uses `csv.reader()` (stdlib). Pre-Week 5: obtain 3 sample CSV exports from beta engineer. `.xrf` XML parser deferred post-beta; use `defusedxml` when built. Resolves Open Question 3.                                                                                                                      |
| CEO-R-6A  | Bell-Delaware vs Kern auto-conservative | If \|BD − Kern\| / BD > 20%, use lower h_o value (Layer 2 rule in `validation_rules.py`). Step 8 AI prompt includes both values and override reason. Resolves Open Question 6 (Decision 3R-7B).                                                                                                                                     |
| CEO-R-7A  | /btw deferred to post-beta              | BTW-1A/2A/3A deferred. Root cause: forward-only /btw creates designs with internal inconsistency (confidence_score doesn't degrade when notes contradict completed steps). Post-beta: implement pre-run notes only first (applied_from_step=1, no confidence gap), then full mid-pipeline with parameter dependency tracking in v2. |
| CEO-R-8A  | wait_for_user() + /respond endpoint     | Specified async pattern: asyncio.Future per session in sse_manager.py, resolved by POST /api/v1/hx/design/{id}/respond. Timeout 300s + future cleanup + waiting_for_user flag.                                                                                                                                                      |
| CEO-R-9A  | Pipeline orphan detection               | heartbeat() + is_orphaned() in session_store.py. PIPELINE_ORPHAN_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=120. waiting_for_user=True excludes session from orphan detection. GET /status returns "failed" for orphaned sessions.                                                                                                                           |
| CEO-R-10A | MongoDB indexes at startup              | Compound index on calibration_records, unique index on users.email. Created at FastAPI lifespan. Idempotent. Failure: exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s then CRITICAL + re-raise.                                                                                                                                                        |

### CEO Plan Amendments (applied to build sequence)

- Day 5: nginx service + nginx.conf in docker-compose.yml; .env + .env.example
- Day 3: ai_engineer.py retry logic; AIModeEnum (not bare str)
- All memory steps: `_safe_memory_call()` wrapper
- Week 6: stream JWT payload includes user_id; InputBar disabled when isEscalated; delete shared-password auth
- Week 5: CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTS constant; CEPCI value 2026 (~816)
- Engineer prompt: prompt injection mitigation in engineer_review.txt
- Models: session_id = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid4()))
- Frontend: ChatWindow error state, ParetoChart loading state, confidence_breakdown expandable in DesignSummary
- Autoresearch: experiments run in memory only — no Redis saves during sweep

### Implementation Decisions (May 2026) — Post-Build Audit

These decisions were made during implementation and are NOT reflected in the original architecture sessions above. All are fully implemented.

| ID      | Decision                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IMPL-1A | Skills-based AI prompt system  | Step-specific prompts moved from inline Python strings to `hx_engine/app/skills/step_XX_*.md` files. `_build_system_prompt(step_id, step_name)` in `ai_engineer.py` loads `base.md` + the step-specific file at runtime. `core/prompts/engineer_review.txt` is deprecated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IMPL-2A | RedesignDriver                 | Autonomous geometry redesign loop in `core/redesign_loop.py`. Triggered when Steps 10/11 raise `DesignConstraintViolation`. `MAX_REDESIGN_ATTEMPTS=8`, `MAX_FALLBACK_ATTEMPTS=2`. 9 legal levers (tube OD, tube length, n_passes, baffle_cut, n_baffles, n_tubes, pitch_ratio, shell_ID, tema_type). AI selects lever; deterministic `_FALLBACK_SEQUENCE` engages when AI lever selection fails. Users are NEVER prompted for internal geometry decisions — all mutations are autonomous. |
| IMPL-3A | Step 7 velocity auto-restart   | Before RedesignDriver activates, the pipeline tries adjusting `n_passes` (double for low velocity, halve for high velocity) and re-runs Steps 5–6 inline. `MAX_VELOCITY_RESTARTS=3`. Counter is separate from RedesignDriver's `redesign_attempt` counter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IMPL-4A | Condensation support           | Shah condensation correlation (`correlations/shah_condensation.py`) added. `FluidProperties` extended with `phase`, `quality`, `latent_heat_J_kg`, `T_sat_C`, `P_sat_Pa`. `IncrementResult` model added for zone-based calculations. `DesignState` carries `hot_phase`/`cold_phase` and `increment_results`. Evaporation/boiling still deferred post-beta.                                                                                                                                |
| IMPL-5A | Volumetric flow input (P2-20)  | `DesignRequest` accepts `hot_flow`/`cold_flow` as `FlowInput(value, unit)` objects instead of bare float kg/s. `volumetric_flow.py` converts to mass flow. `DesignState` carries `hot_flow_input`, `cold_flow_input`, `flow_density_drift` for audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IMPL-6A | Requirements token flow        | Two-step validation: `POST /api/v1/hx/requirements` validates request → returns HMAC-signed token → `POST /api/v1/hx/design` accepts token. Token is optional; /design works without it (runs validation inline). Token is signed with `HX_ENGINE_SECRET`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IMPL-7A | FluidProperties.name removed   | `FluidProperties` model is now anonymous — the `name` field was removed. Fluid names live on `DesignState` as `hot_fluid_name: Optional[str]` and `cold_fluid_name: Optional[str]`. Any code using `state.shell_fluid.name` or `state.tube_fluid.name` must be updated to use `state.hot_fluid_name`/`state.cold_fluid_name`. `CalibrationKey.from_state()` must use these fields.                                                                                                        |
| IMPL-8A | Thermo 5-tier chain            | `thermo_adapter.py` priority chain extended to 5 tiers: iapws → CoolProp → Petroleum correlations (`petroleum_correlations.py` — Lee-Kesler/Beggs-Robinson/Cragoe) → Specialty → thermo (Caleb Bell). New public API: `get_saturation_props()` and `get_cp()`. `property_source` and `property_confidence` track which tier was used.                                                                                                                                                     |
| IMPL-9A | USER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT extended | `USER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 3600` (1 hour) in `pipeline_runner.py`. See Open Question 7 — RESOLVED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## 22. Open Questions

1. **Accuracy trust threshold:** At what U/dP deviation does an engineer lose trust? 5%? 10%? This determines whether calibration.py is needed from day one. The HTRI Comparison workflow (Week 5) will answer this empirically.
2. ~~**First beta user with HTRI access:**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-03-20)** — Beta engineer with HTRI access confirmed. See §24 Beta User Onboarding Checklist for pre-Week-5 coordination steps.
3. ~~**HTRI output format in the field:**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-03-21)** — **CSV first, .xrf post-beta.** `htri_parser.py` in Week 5 uses `csv.reader()` (stdlib). Pre-Week 5: obtain 3 sample CSV exports from beta engineer to validate column names. `.xrf` XML parser deferred to post-beta; when built, use `defusedxml` (XXE mitigation). See §21 Decision CEO-R-5A.
4. ~~**Regulatory/liability positioning:**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-03-20)** — **"Decision support"** for beta. All Step 16 output and frontend copy labeled `FOR REVIEW ONLY — verify with licensed engineer`. Confidence score displayed as a suggestion, not a certification. Revisit "fabrication-ready" after first 10+ HTRI comparisons and accuracy data. See §21 Decision CEO-R-2A.
5. ~~**Pricing model:**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-03-20)** — **Org/team seat license** selected. Week 6 auth builds `subscription_active` check per `org_id`; returns `True` for all beta users. If Week 6 auth slips, beta users default to `subscription_active=True` — no one is blocked. See §21 Decision CEO-R-3A.
6. ~~**Decision 3R-7B (Bell-Delaware vs. Kern cross-check divergence):**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-03-21)** — **Auto-conservative.** When |BD − Kern| / BD > 20%, use the lower of the two h_o values (Layer 2 rule in `validation_rules.py`). AI sees both values and the override reason in Step 8 prompt. See §21 Decision CEO-R-6A and §14 Week 3.
7. ~~**ESCALATED step timeout policy:**~~ **RESOLVED (2026-05)** — `USER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT = 3600` (1 hour) implemented in `pipeline_runner.py`. After 1 hour with no `/respond` call, the session is treated as abandoned and the pipeline raises a timeout error. Orphan detection (`is_orphaned()` in `session_store.py`) excludes sessions with `waiting_for_user=True` for the full 1-hour window. See §21 Decision IMPL-9A.

| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First HTRI comparison < 10% deviation on U | Ask the engineer if he'd show it to one colleague at his firm          |
| 2–3 engineers at one firm using ARKEN      | The wedge is open — prepare an org-level demo                          |
| Firm asks for more than 2 seats            | Trigger paid conversion (org/team seat license, see Decision CEO-R-3A) |

These are the three steps from first successful comparison to first revenue. The org-level pain (1–2 HTRI seats for 15 engineers) means conversion follows naturally once the product proves its accuracy within one firm.

## 24. Beta User Onboarding Checklist

**Engineer:** Confirmed — process engineer with HTRI access. Target first session: Week 5.

**Before Week 1 coding starts:**

0. **Demand signal call (30 minutes, do this before writing a line of code).** Call the beta engineer or another process engineer from your network. Ask them to walk through their last heat exchanger design: "What took the longest?" "What would have made it faster?" "How did you check if the design was right?" At the end, ask directly: "If a tool could give you a first-pass design in 2 minutes with a confidence score and step-by-step audit trail — what would that be worth to your team per month?" Document their answer (a number, a range, or an explicit rejection). This is not the HTRI comparison session — it is demand validation before building. If the answer is "I'd use it but we'd never pay for it" — that is signal you need before writing 3 weeks of code.

**Before the first comparison session (complete by end of Week 4):**

1. **Agree on test case** — Confirm a single-phase liquid case: crude oil cooling is the preferred test (matches ARKEN Phase 1 scope and Serth 5.1 benchmark). Provide the engineer with the input format: fluid identities, flow rates (kg/s), inlet/outlet temperatures, pressure if known. Do NOT use a two-phase, condensing, or boiling case — ARKEN Phase 1 is single-phase liquids only.

2. **Share the disclaimer** — Before the engineer sees any ARKEN output, send him the following copy:

   > _"ARKEN AI is a first-pass design decision support tool. All outputs are labeled FOR REVIEW ONLY and must be verified by a licensed process engineer before use in fabrication or procurement. This is not a substitute for HTRI Xchanger Suite or a stamped design."_
   > This sets the right expectation. He is not evaluating a finished product — he is helping validate accuracy at the Step 8 (overall U) and Step 10 (pressure drop) level.

3. **Get HTRI values before the call** — Ask the engineer to run the same case in HTRI and note: `U_overall` (W/m²K), `dP_shell` (bar), `dP_tube` (bar). These are the three fields in the manual entry comparison form. He does not need to share the full `.xrf` file (though that is also accepted).

4. **Run the first session together on a call** — Do not send a link and wait async. Run the first comparison side-by-side on a screen share. If ARKEN misses by > 10% on U, you want to be there to understand why (geometry mismatch, fluid property difference, unit confusion) — not to receive a WhatsApp message saying "it was 18% off."

**Success criterion for first session:** Deviation < 10% on U. If ≥ 10%, debug live on the call — most likely cause is a geometry input mismatch, not a correlation error. See §22 Open Question #1 for the accuracy trust threshold question this session will answer.

## Verification (end-to-end test flow)

1. `docker-compose up`
2. Open frontend at http://localhost (via nginx)
3. Login with admin-created credentials
4. Type: "Design a heat exchanger for cooling 50 kg/s of crude oil from 150°C to 90°C using cooling water at 30°C"
5. Observe: 16 StepCards appear live (steps 1–16 streaming via nginx-proxied SSE)
6. Step 12 shows an IterationBadge counting convergence iterations
7. Final StepCard shows confidence_score ≥ 0.70 with expandable confidence_breakdown
8. Disconnect wifi during Step 9 → UI falls back to poll → reconnects on Step 14
9. Ask: "Optimize for cost" → ParetoChart appears with ≥ 3 Pareto points
10. Check MongoDB: design result stored via internal webhook
